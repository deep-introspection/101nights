I am the leader in the new building of the atelier. High ceilings are being built, just about to be finished. The workers are still busy placing tiles on the floor, the windows, the door…
 
Huna, my assistant, seems uncertain about what I'm doing. She fears I do not want to be interrupted by anyone; I want to be at peace. The fact is, I hope to organize a studio opening soon, on the upcoming week. It is not a big event, just some acquaintances, art collectors and some friends of mine. I know I must celebrate the new building with at least one social gathering.
 
However, it is still under construction, and the workers are fixing some details so it can be ready on time for the studio visit. In the end, I remember sitting on the outside, just observing the yard in the penumbra. In the distance I see a hill with a very high tree on top, the trunk long and thin, the bark light in color. Up there, the branches and the foliage are shaped as a drop, with ocher yellow, small leaves moving softly, back and forth along with the wind. Two big, impressive flowers, with large white and light purple petals, yellow on the inside, overlap disproportionately with the tree. They are that big.


‘What kind of tree is that?’ ‒I ask myself. ‘And those flowers?’ In that moment I understand they are there as a protection, to support the community of people in the studio and myself.

I remember an ephemeral fragment of a dream. A pure feeling towards Mijael invades me, just like when we were young. Enthusiastic about the things we do together, and to have some adventure in our lives, Mija insists on going somewhere else to look for something. It is a place I recognize; he is searching for red paint, and probably Giselle is with us. I love to see Mijael doing whatever he wants; living freely.


I know there is a reason why I dreamt about that. However, I wake up in the middle of the night and I disconnect myself from the machine. Later on, I have to restart the recording. I drink some water and start again.

I dreamt about my friend Mauro. I must do the paperwork to buy a house, but he insists on taking me first to one of those places where they sell the cheapest beer in town. I agree, so he takes me to a popular place located on the edge of the city, and from there I can see a building being demolished. Suddenly, I realise the computer has stopped recording my dreams!


I remember another powerful fragment. An archangel and I are in a pure, white, round space, empty, four times bigger than Lyrica. I do not see him, but I do feel his presence. He is showing our studio to his friend Jorge Vázquez.


The space has no floor or ceiling; it is just a radiant white light. One element stands out: the doors, two impressive wooden wheels like shields that slide on a circular rail which allow to see the studio from the outside in 180 degrees. More light gets inside through them. In the dream I notice these doors slide even more smoothly than the ones we have in Lyrica.  


My friend Eddie Castañeda arrives. Glad to see him again, I feel enthused over my project to record EEGs, and I want to show it to him. So I open the site Guillaume made and the interface shows a fun animation. It does not report the project as such, however at least I think it shows diversity in the type of information. Eddie does not seem as interested as I would expect.

I remember a dream that is way too intense.
We throw ourselves into the void, throughout a great flow of energy. Pierre Bellec is a companion. His presence, a true privilege, inspires me pure love. I refuse to remember the place he took me to. A great opportunity is present due to his appearance, however I do not believe it.


The dream continues.
I am in the shore, by the sea, with Eddie. I am willing to take him somewhere I cannot recall. We carry a white cardboard; possibly a part of a new project. On our way, we are forced to stop in a woman’s office; she blocks our path with her administration.

I remembe an ephemeral visit. Nico Lavergne ‒and perhaps my friend Beussai‒ came all the way from the atelier in Montreuil to see me. It’s a privilege to receive them in my studio, a prison from where I cannot leave. Their visit makes me really happy. We smoke cannabis and chat.
Nico confesses his friendship with Totoff came to an end because he took his girlfriend away. It’s a shame, but that's the way it is. On time, they must leave.  Everything comes to an end, and I must accept it. I do not want them to leave, but there is nothing I can do about it. Such a familiar feeling. I look around and I realise my atelier looks more like a living room than an artists' workshop.
I am alone.


The foyer on the ground floor looks like the lobby of a luxury hotel. A car awaits; Juan Jose Rivas is their driver. I suppose he will take them to the airport.
I feel grateful for their visit.

I remember dreaming about two men driving. We arrive to the parking lot of the workshop. It is a new space, not an empty one. For some reason I need to get some personal validation on that studio. We open the last pages of the artbook of a great painter, a master. We turn the sheets till we reach the beginning. I want to show them these paintings and my own work have at least common origins. A thin translucent veil applied over a white surface, a layer of graded values of gray pigment comes first. Just like the background color of a painting I’ve brought to my studio. There is no doubt now.


Here is another fragment. I enter my studio. Some workers are still plastering the walls. I ask them to work on a detail: a cement-colored frieze at the angle of the main wall and the floor. They made the frieze too high and reduced the white surface needed as a support for my paintings. I draw black lines on a white paper for reference, and when I sketch the last two lines of the perspective, all of a sudden the geometry in the space changes: the horizon is lower, leaving the observer with the illusion of a higher point of view (45º).


There is a dynamic atmosphere in the building. Now there are not only workers, but artists, as well and people visiting the studio.
An acquaintance arrives, and for some reason he thinks it is my parents' house. Perhaps I lied, but I make it clear this time: this is my studio space.


Together we finish the workshops. Marcela Armas suggests we use a left over tin of paint, and she covers with it the steel beams on the ground floor. When I come down I get surprised: the beams are painted in red! Now the space is red and black; red is a live color, and the idea is good, but a bit intense for me. We leave it for now, but in the long term we should reconsider the color.

I wake up in an apartment in Paris. Guillaume and I live together.
When I wake up, he is not there anymore; he left without a word.


Bewildered, I decide to get even and leave. The idea of me leaving is his weak spot, so it Will cause him instability. I pack my stuff, and as I approach the window I feel frightened to death. I feel dizzy, as if I was about to fall.
 
I approach the window again, more carefully this time. The avenue is crowded as it is labor’s day. I guess May must have arrived. What is it about that building that catches my attention? Maybe the way it is decorated. Up there, I can buy a green bag, big enough to fit most of my things, for 10 pesos. If Guillaume comes back I won’t be there. Or maybe he will find me here, graciously dressed, my bag matching my clothes. This time I dressed up to leave the relationship.
 
Tired of the sun, I walk by the Street under the shade. In my dreams, the city reminds me of Valparaiso. Oh, look, there it is! I come across a sign. It is Pablo, an Italian restaurant which is supposed to be the best in town.

I find myself living temporarily in a house with Roberto while I dream; we are working on a project together. In the morning, he is about to take a shower and he comes out from the bathroom naked. A white tube hangs between his legs, covering his genitals. Shyness fades away as I see him for the first time. 


I find a drawing among my papers; it resembles those made by Mijael inspired by Daumier. I know Roberto fancies Mijael’s drawings, so I give it to him as a gift to decorate the new house he moved in at with Katja. Roberto reacts strangely, asking me defensively: “how much money do you want for the drawing?”. The truth is I have never charged him for anything. I do not say a word. He does not accept the present.


Katja comes over, asking if I can lend her some clothes. I guess she knows better than myself my suitcase is small but very well stocked. I'm looking for a pair of jeans, but I think they're too big for her. I am not going to give her my best trousers, but I do have enough clothes to lend her something.

I'm in Los Angeles traveling with my mother. Then, for some reason, I comes to my mind people don’t have good taste. We can see another city in the distance; a glimpse of a skyline, a panoramic view of Vancouver. I must go by myself. 


I take a look around. Far away some black balloons fly elegantly in the sky. As soon as I get there, I meet Johanna. Her situation allows her to live in that luxurious city. She offers to show me her trousers, and I agree with expectation. So there they are: two pairs of comfy, loose trousers, one black and the other with brown spots. I help her fold them on a hanger so she can store them. 


Johanna takes me on a journey in her black balloon. We walk down an avenue and we take off, smoothly. We do not rise much when Johanna, wisely, decides to go back to the earth gently, because she saw some people crossing the avenue.

I speak with the mother of Arcangel. I ask her: “how far are you from home?” She answers she does not come from her house. She's staying somewhere else, a little closer, in the same direction going by Periférico Avenue. “So, is your house further away?,” I insist. Her attitude is distant; she doesn’t say much.


The sister of Arcangel is more open to talk. She takes me to a market to see some handbags she likes. Excited, I go and take a look.
They are seriously fashionable purses. Big and gold, metallic, embroidered with stones. I suggest she should buy one but she fancies more another.


Nap (no EEg).


Curiously, Meg enters the apartment. The smell of hot wax brings her here. I am asleep and I wake up altered. 
– “There is something strange here,” she exclaims.
I jump off my bed and I can see her brushes and painting material under.
I get up and find myself lying in a fetal position under a table.
– “Please tell me this is not a dream!” I mean it seriously.

At first my memory is weak but then I remember a dream.
We have an agreement with Gabriel Elizondo, in relation to a space that I have to lend him in exchange for a contract. I must open a door to him. 


Gabriel is expecting a copy of the book of dreams I published.
My mother indiscreetly hears about the book and she also asks me for a copy. To avoid problems, I would prefer that she don’t read it because there are fragments that mention of our sometimes precarious relationship.


I’m in the middle of a contradiction, caught in between the contract I've with Gabriel and the limit I would like to put, with my mother.


I’m surrounded by friends and acquaintances. Tonight it's the new year's eve and I go outside to wonder how the others will celebrate it.


I meet Mane by chance outside her family' house. Sota's have a house in a big piece of land with an arcade as entrance. I ask her how they’ll celebrate it and she says they plan to share that night only in between them. Mane tells me that she can invite me, as long as I go alone. The people that come with me cannot attend, is a closed family group I believe.


Others, will also celebrate among their own acquaintances, each group separately.


Gabriel asks me what I'm going to do but I'm still figuring out my options.


In the end I remember, Arcangel, Erika and I, setting up an exhibition for Gabriel. I have to coordinate them. The work is an installation which consist of a horse and 4 butterflies hanging from the ceiling, the issue is that we have very little time. At first we had two weeks but now we only have four hours. The most efficient way would be to use the butterflies Erika gave me and I would just have to paint the horse.


The best I could negotiate with Gabriel is that, in order to finance the expenses and, it does not seem expensive to me, Erika pays 25 dollars, so Arcangel and I together could put the other 50%

I remember a fragment it sums up a creative gesture, I'm with Said making a table. We started looking for a base and a platform among waste material left. We found a painted metal base of color and looked for a platform to put it on. Mari Carmen appears but she’s not happy that we settle there because she thinks we're far from everything.


We are in a house in the countryside. I try to convince Mari that this place has a future. There’re still no houses around but with two or three houses it would be enough to make a village, just with a couple of more houses, that's all !


Then I remember that the table is not a table but a glass ceiling. A new construction that I see with enthusiasm.


Finally I remember preparing to take a flight, the plane comes from the United States and is going to Oregon, in my dream is heading for Europe.

I remember a dream when suddenly I realize that I'm in my apartment in Mexico, in the library room in a perfectly real situation, walking around with the helmet and the electrodes, unplugged. I start to suspect. How can I be here with the cable cord, unplugged the computer, when I am sure that I just started recording my dreams?


I realize I'm dreaming, I can be both here and there. In the dream, I enter in a state of total and brilliant lucidity, a reality of its own an experience without consequences on the outside. What do I see? It had to be Guillaume in front of me, in a flagrant emotional situation - entirely determined to let himself go by his desire without taboos.


I can only accept myself and be open to the freedom of this experience. In a receptive way, I observe without intervening or saying anything.


We lie down in the floor, I embrace Guillaume from behind, I feel the skin of his back, his bare torso, is the skin of a young kid. Morally, I have to accept that that we're heading towards a sexual scene, just that and nothing more. 


–"The option of having an orgasm would be good for my health. May be." I think.


A baby monkey wanders through the bedroom furniture. I let myself be carried by the caresses of Guillaume as fluid as possible, with the erotic positions that are required. I am naked, bent with my head upside down glued to the window, freed of all morals. 


As far as I can remember, there's no sexual intercourse neither experience of orgasm. 


Not even that. The promise does not hold. Perhaps is lack of faith. I can still see the room, now empty. I slowly see the image fades.


My attention now focus on a moral conflict, how can I do so this information does not compromise anyone?


A new fragment of a dream, I find myself here, this apartment is a big mess. I got out of bed, still with the electrodes on my scalp I just  finished recording my dreams. A lady comes in to clean the apartment. Perfect! Exactly what I need.

I remember dreaming that I'm getting ready to spend the weekend somewhere else. I do not know where we came from, Guillaume and I decided spontaneously go to spend the weekend elsewhere.
I'm looking for a pair of comfortable socks suitable for my black shoes. Giselle helps me find them. I put one sock on another. It happens that they are not black but white. Guillaume instead only takes what he wears.
On the contrary, I need to take what is necessary to sleep. In a small bag I carry Lyrica. 
It's daylight, Guillaume confesses that he is worried about money. He thinks he's going to need 800 pesos for weekend expenses, It seems to me little money for a week-end, I think I could lend him 1000 but I do not say anything.

I drive a car through the subway's narrow underground corridors. Arcangel goes by my side. We advance and made our way through the access, down the escalators and the different levels, even over the roof of the wagons, towards the exit. 


Just another fragment of a dream. Someone tells me that he saw a Frenchman passing by, the one who works in an art organization. I assume it's Michel Blancsubé. He tells me that in the afternoon he went to do a different activity of personal order. I suppose he has the freedom to do it.

The ephemeral memory of a dream, I remember to rise in front of a mural. At the moment of descending, I pass in front of a fragment of the painting, it's a small human figure and I draw it in question of seconds. When I get to the ground and a man wants to retain my drawing.

I just remember few fragments of my dream. I'm accompanied with a man, probably Arcangel. I'm hungry and prepare roots vegetables with cream for food and bring it to a restaurant where we sit. In the same table there's another man, I don't know him, it seems to be an acquaintance from Arcangel. I see him eating a bowl of vegetable soup with almonds. It whets my appetite and I would like to order another, and as side dish, the salad I made. I think the man says to Arcangel, he doesn't want to eat his soup, that we can have it. There's no point to order another, then. I watch Arcangel how he's with a spoon eating the soup. I keep in silence, waiting he's going to pass me some soup, but he doesn't. I fear there's a misunderstanding. Now we have to leave the restaurant and I'm starving. 


Another piece of a dream, I see Memo Roel intentionate and friendly. I hardly recognize his kindness, may be because it's a long time that I haven't seeing him.


At the end of the night I vaguely remember Aman Badhwar judging something she doesn't like. I feel exhausted and I cannot engage in others’ people feelings, I have to go direct to the point as a way to economize my forces. 


We’re in a shop looking for a new bed and there's something about it, she would like to criticize. The base is strong, made by two pieces assembled under a new mattress. I believe is well constructed. 


I remember to dream when I'm in the garden of this house, in the same spot under the tree where we use to take a break with Guillaume. Suddenly he arrives and brings two pair of shoes for me, one is beige the other is black, a cute pair of sandals and a nice surprise.

A piece of memory of my dream is an episode in which some workers are in the atelier generating movement. I had to go out, for some reason when suddenly I realize that I would do better if I go back to my studio. 
 
It seems they have thrown a party. Sergio the blacksmith is among the people, his behaviour extroverted whistling from one side to the other projecting himself enthused. I think he has finished work and he's going back home.


Sergio did a radio broadcast at 4:40 expecting to see me there and I wasn't.

The only tiny bit of a dream I recall: my commitment to this project is total and it’s with courage that I go ahead.


A dream in a dream. I find myself lying on a bed in my mother's house, in Chile. For several weeks I've been in this room working with the electrodes and in this sense, she has been very patient. Suddenly I wonder, why I came here? I have not even seen my mother! I should tell her to have dinner together. 


When she goes down into the bathroom in my room. I'm lying on the bed, half awake inside my dream I draw circles. 
She's about to wake me up but the tiredness keeps me motionless, though from that state, I can manage to communicate with my mother and tell her that I can not wake up. My mother understands very well that to rest is for me vital and she goes. I am still sleeping and dreaming partially awake inside a dream.


Then I remember lying on my bed now in my house now. From where I can see through the reflection of the glass of the window a scene in the street, someone standing in front of the metal curtain.


From the silence of my voice I shout: Eddie! Eddie!

I dream that I climb up a fire escape from the outside at the top of a building when I get the feeling of falling back down but managed to control it and attach my body to the parapet to pass it on the other side. I clung to the parapet to pass the body as I can. When I get upstairs I say – "what is this?" here they should put a fence, that would be the right thing to do.


When I arrive at the roof terrace I enter from behind where I see several vans in a parking lot. Surprised, I see Giselle and her family get out of them.

I faintly recall, we wear with Moises Vargas only this and nothing more. 


I dream we have just finished to paint the walls of my studio in white. Only now I can see the space, not before. There are several studios divided walls. Some of the spaces are rather narrow, others in medium size over two floors. I reckon, there are surplus of walls but now it's too late. 


Some people are coming to visit –may be students– that are rather surprised by the construction I must admit that I am too. It's all new to me, we have just finished them last week. I show them the use this spaces, starting from the ground floor. In the entrance there is a place for commercial activity, we have got already one. There there is an empty space that I would like to have an international transport shop, for the artwork. 
 
In the first floor there's several studios, just the size for a stretcher flat, in horizontal position, and the room to work around it. There are other spaces big enough for when it will be necessary, to move the body in order to apply painting for the backgrounds. 


In my opinion there are walls that are unnecessary. The space revealed to me only after being painted in white. 


I am with a man –it could be my partner– he commissioned a small roof outside all along a window, one meter size, semicircular made of concrete, not good at all. It has to be done in wood I think. 


Now we are prepared to open the studios and bring artist from abroad to work in here.

I remember a dream, I was in a meeting with people, it was a girl that got engaged with the Korean Ambassador. Her new situation drop her up for a new Social Status. She is a serious girl and feels committed because it's her family tradition, they also were related in some way with diplomatics. 
There is  a restroom in the ambassador's house, some of the tiles on the floor are broken, others dirty, it would be good to change them in order to tidy the ambassador's restroom I think. I have some mosaic left in my studio and I offer myself to help to replace them. Even though they are not exactly the same, I have an idea for a nice detail in the carpet design. She's not for it, not against. 


I wake up and fall asleep again. I am in the same dream, decided to repair the floor of the ambassador's restroom, I come to the girl and ask for the keys. As if I was a stranger, she denies to give the keys of the Koreans ambassador's, I leave.  


I am in a bus stop towards Viña Del Mar, it's not a formal bus station but just a point in the middle of the highway passing the highway toll. I see a bus  and want to jump on it but seems to go in an opposite direction, it does not even open the door to me to go and park in another place. 
Where am I? in places like this there is often an underground station and I am going to find out. I found in fact there is one, the last stop of the of one of the lines. This orientate me not to take the train but to go to catch another bus, I finally find a bus in which there is one seat left for me, in the middle of the corridor. I sit and start to chat with a woman beside me, the conversation drives me to another scene. Now we are walking in the middle of the nature somewhere near the highway. There is Marguerite Pilven with one of her sisters. They would like to be able to afford a trip by bus to go to Madrid, but unfortunately they cannot afford such thing because they belong to a low social class, I am concerned they probably will never be able to have the chance. 


I am now in Vina Del Mar and I find myself with are a bunch of people coming from a different countries that somehow remains to me to the master's degree but years after like in a meeting of old students. I'm standing in the sand on the beach is night time. There is a Scottish fellow his name is Eric, he has a mark of a strong scottish accent. I ask him," where are you from in Scotland?" he replies with the name of a place that seems completely unknown to me so then I asked him again, "it must be a wee town" he says nothing, his attention is put on his boyfriend she is embracing. I don't mind him being gay, I would like to invite them to visit Valaraíso. From the distance we can see the typical profile of its characteristic houses going down the cliff. I insist, Valparaiso a special place full of charm that I believe they should see, when suddenly I fall in a hole made in the sand Lorena comes to see what happens to me but it's not bad it's just funny. I would like to bring them to a bar in Valparaiso but she thinks that it's too far to go. I argue "last time I came to Chile I didn't go" Valparaiso is a place also special to her and I know she will understand. 


On the way there I meet with a girl at first I assume she is also an artist from the Masters but in some way she makes me doubt if she's an artist –for some reason I never get to know– these days the art world gathers people that are not necessary formed in Fine Arts. The woman has a different intention towards me, she approaches and rub my lips with her, long and thin tongue. I feel free and open, I close my eyes to go for a kiss.
 
My attention suddenly perceive Fred Pedersen arriving to the foyer with a six-pack of beers. I get really excited to see him after a long time since the Masters although he's not and has never been really expressive. I was about to get some beers with him when I realize I cannot because later on tonight i'm recording my dreams with the electrodes. In that way I cannot get drunk, not even close to it. 
In last fragment of the dream I'm explaining the project I am doing to her: in the same way I did the painting during the Masters, do you remember? In which I paint tiny bits of colours in order to construct a large image, in here also bit by bit, over a long period of time, I am building a large image but with different tools.

I remember in my dream I was with Andrea de Lorenzo and his brother Luis. They acquired a new and basic car for their mom, is not new but second or third-hand. They start to run the engine, when I noticed the exhaust pipe is emitting a flame. As it is old, I fear that there's also a fugue coming from beneath the car a puddle of oil left in the floor which is flammable and they could start a fire. I am worried and ask them to stop the engine of the car. I rather leave but before that Luis comes to offer me as a gift a decorative object, a window frame in small size of Andalusian style. I take it and put it against a white wall, for me it looks more like a conceptual sculpture.   


Not far from there, the ambient is effervescent. I remember to see Lorena.
I am with Sergio the blacksmith, I ask him why he doesn't come to my studio to finish his work. Apparently he has plenty of work, and seems to not care about money. I wonder if he notice in his bank account, if there is a new deposit, but it seems that it doesn't. I understand if there is little money, it can pass unnoticed but if it is 15 or 35 thousand it has to be noticed. 
Sergio is taken but another business. Not far from there there is a completely different thing happening, there are elections in order to choose a delegate and Sergio, the blacksmith, is one between a list of 42 or 48 candidates. 
I am going to vote for him I know he's valuable man I trust him as a human being I believe he can be a good leader. There's Montse, I advise her to vote for Sergio. His name on the list and appears as Sergio Serrano. 
During the social meeting there is food. I am eating a sweet pudding, made of black beans and papaya. I can't stop eating but I think that now I should start fasting for 16 hours. It can represent some effort at the beginning, but once I get used to it it's not hard. 
At the end of the dream I meet with Sergio again, I think Montse and Sergio, they get along well together. He tells me, she has commissioned him a structure for her artistic work settings, in the field of theater for a thousand pesos.

I recall a dream, I’m with Mauro and someone else. I’m doing a drawing in black Ink, of abstract characters, writing the name of my beloved. I vaguely can see the letter A but the intention is clearly there. Suddenly a reflection of the red container in Lyrica atelier, appears in my page and reveals the space of the studio, where he lives. 
Together Mauro, me and the other person –could be Chelo or Hernan– we move to another place but before, I like to show them that I have finished a new artist book with the drawings that I made in the last few days. In fact I did two books. I’ve accomplished a lot of work, I feel proud of it. 


We enter in gymnasium where there’s a championship of artistic gymnastics, I see myself reflected.
They’re in the last rehearsing before the presentation with the judges. Mauro, the other guy and I, are sitting in between the public when one of the gymnasts starts in the parallel bars. The apparatus is dysfunctional she can't really do her routine because one of the bars is way too thick – about 18 centimetres of diameter– 
There's another odd apparatus, something I haven't seen before, is a square platform, same high as the beam, made by loose planks of wood, none of which are fixed. It must be hard to keep a balance, I think. I ask one of the gymnasts, since when they include this apparatus as part of the discipline? A long time ago, she replies, since the time of my parents. She doesn't seem very young, I guess she’s of a senior category, the same is for many others in this championship. 
I'm surprised this bizarre apparatus exists since long ago and I didn't know it! 


We go out of the gymnasium, it's night time. A man approaches in his Jeep, he's a soldier we jump into his car. It's strange, he drives us close to the side of the road, over the parapet dividing the pavement with the land and drives down the slope. His manoeuvres his jeep with great skills and goes down softly. He stops in front of the door of his house, a small and austere single room. I'm alone with him standing outside but looking inside. I feel shy, although he's a friendly guy.

At the beginning of the night I'm lying down in my bed, nicely and calmly when I hear my mom entering the house, I go to the kitchen of a well-set home. I wasn't expecting to have dinner but she offers me a glass of red wine and I accept it. When I approach the fridge she asks me I would like a king crab leg –like Adam's apple– who could deny such delicacy? 
In some middle of the night Alejandra comes down from up the hill and shows in the kitchen which makes me glad she is a good friend from childhood and I propose her to share a glass of wine. 
Just after her mom and her aunt come. For some reason that I don't understand my mother that used to be a close friend from them don't talk to each other anymore thing that I consider to be sad. No more than that. I go, myself, to say hello and in fact her aunt, appears to me like a stranger maybe because I haven't seen her for years. 


More down I'm here there is a house in which there's few artists working. When I see Arcangel coming back from a long trip young with long hair in 80s fashion style – in a way that I have seen in old pictures– I am excited to see him back and go towards him in order to embrace him but is indifferent he stands only for himself and pays no much attention to me. At that moment I tell him how I did get here, starting from the moment I was calm in bed, to when I meet Ale my old friend. I cannot see him less interested on my emotional subtleties he's rather interested in banal social life. Besides us there is a girl friend of Arcangel waiting to see him, she appears to me as a millennium pop-girl, despite her childish fashion –I believe she can be nice just because she's a friend of him–. Because my desire drives me towards Arcangel, I want attract his attention, I hide my feelings and behave as what I think is of his interest.  
I start to behave as best as I can desirable, playing the role of an Oriental femme fatale. I see myself on a red silk robe, nude underneath with a certain class but with no pride. When suddenly the house burns. The flames take amplitude very fast, the entire house get in fire. Arcangel has disappeared and I am desperately try to find him I go everywhere trying to search for him, shouting his name all over but without chance. The situation became oddly serious, the fire is now everywhere leaving only the way for me to escape by a corridor –a wall made of stones– in the back street of the house. I have to pass by a studio, where there are designers, still there working, on a less sensitive and emotional work and less concerned by the incident. I save my life and get to the street but with the fire I have lost all my dream-work. The box with the manuscripts "Bed-Time-Stories" has burned as well as my artist books with collages, everything is lost. This is a major loss now I have to start again. My only relief is that I still have 20 more years of life to build another diary. Only this and nothing more it's left for me. The house has not disappear completely, the fire only destroyed the roof in relation to this, the only good thing, is that now we can rebuild a better one. Arcangel has escaped and I meet him outside. When I tell him, my dream-work is burned, and I have lost everything, everything I was expecting from him is a hug or any kind of comfort but instead his attitude is disengaged, distant and indifferent. There's not a sole sign of empathy from him. Now I understand there's no hope of a relationship that I've to leave and find a new life for me on my own. 


In the next dream, after all this time, I decided spend a weekend with Anshul to change my ideas. We are in a hotel –in a place called San Jose of something– with us a boy of about 12 years old. We are in the parking area, from afar I can see a gang of teenagers in an informal martial arts meeting, like street fighters. From the distance I can only see black shapes and they show an amazing talent of metamorphose with the world of insect in an accurate way. 
I feel my back contracted the recent tension, stiff as a stone, I really need a massage. I asked him, the young guy, if he knows a woman in the Pueblo, if he perhaps have seen a sign of someone giving the service for a massage. There is no answer coming from him. 


In the close distance I see a couple of fighters on the other side of the parking taking a astonishing insect shape. They fit their bodies, hands and legs together, synchronized in the shape of a spider walking. I believe they are really talented there is no form of human trace. 


I see horrified that Anshul got in his hand the circuit that Guillaume made for the project. How can it be? I cannot believe that I left my work with the electrodes to come here? I must be mad!! I should never have done that. I take the circuit with the cable and the plugs hoping that they are not disconnected It would be difficult for me to restore them. It should never have come here, I am really sorry to have left my work. I'm in a hurry to get back to my workplace.




I go back to boundless landscape where I see Guillaume, he has been recording his dreams with EEG as well and is proudly showing a high-level rendering of his ultimate register. He managed to make a visualization from the EEG Digital Data and reloads it, featuring an original dream as an immersive virtual landscape that anyone can give evidence that I'm now able to see, with only very few others fellows. 


I'm now in Guillaume Dumas’ dream, a dream within a dream. I see around me astonished of such clear images. He warns us that he's going to play his dream. We’re only allowed to see like a film. 


–"Now look" he says proudly of his achievement and the action takes in a remote area, where the land and the sea mingle in a mysterious atmosphere. An enormous  snake grows bigger and bigger surrounding the coast of the land, is creeping towards us, tossed and plunges into the sea. Guillaume shows then a marine creature, a whale of remarkable size and deformed head, releasing a nasty smile with big teeth in front of us now in the seaside. I have my own depiction code or interpretation of his dream, I share it with him. 
–"Big fishes are of prosperity, I tell him, even more if they show their teeth"


I recall most of all, the high definition quality of the image. When I see the sky is neat as in real life. I can't wait to see my last dream with Anshul. I’m convinced that this is going to be an interesting tool for psychologists though.
 
Looking towards the right side, the dream continues with another scene. The interface of a computer animation, an inorganic resolution representing a virtual world of a biological brain. Two hemispheres being assembled in one piece interacting with a body lying on a table, enabling an interface that builds a new network, a blood sort of system structure shape, seems to create an Android. All really amazing. 


I'm impressed the high definition quality of the image. I see the sky clear definite as in real life. I can't wait see my last dream with Anshul. I’m convinced that this is going to be an interesting tool for psychologists though.




Even more to the right the next scene within the landscape. I see simultaneously both bays, in one, sea is flat the other I notice the water is vibrating. I observe in curiosity trying to understand what is containing. Christ emerges lightly from the water, appearing in its perfection surrounded by light, in body and soul. 


That’s Guillaume’s dream and I suddenly realize I have to make my way back for my body is lying down with the electrodes for too long now. It’s time to get back.

In dream, my point of observation is from above the horizontal line. 
The landscape is surrounded by the forest, similar to friendly's neighborhood in Eugene, where I live. 


A car is going around a hill covered on pine trees with a set of flags blowing, attached to it. As it runs around an alley of a circular shape. 
Six flags all together attached and stitch from their corner, 3 and three, showing there impetus, "I like Flags", I think. 
They look to me like the prayer flags in Nepal, square in shape white color, printed with a red symbol dispatching wishes of happiness.
The car passes again and the flags takes fly but this time there is one flag missing, maybe because I have to amend it. 
I am leaving nearby in a small apartment, my thought in the dream is that my neighbors believe I belong so the communist party. I was inside my place when a young girl comes in, for some reason, to knock my door, when I see her young and beautiful dressed in leggings, I feel attracted and approach my booty enough to touch her sex with my hand. Soon she leaves. " before I wasn't perverted like that" I say to myself. 


In another dream I'm in an old building in my room as a first degree student. Tonight there’s a big party of the Uni in that building that I do not intend to go because I believe I don't know anyone. In my room I have only a desk and a door that I cannot close properly as the key is not working, although there’s no windows, I feel in peace there. In front of my table I have carefully hang on the wall I set of feathers – a collection of trophies– a beautiful range of light Violet feathers, only one of them is metallic blue and black. 


For the students they start to arrive but I am concerned I cannot lock my door and so then, I cannot leave the room alone. The corridors of the building are starting to get crowded in between the people I see Francisca Hevia coming. She's interested to get a degree, like anyone else but for her that's the most important thing. I know there is a Student Association upstairs that they are giving a degree in laws for free and I tell her. 
By now the whole building is taken by the party when I see Mijael coming. I allow Mija to get inside my room, show him my collection of feathers, one of them has fallen behind the desk soon I take it from the floor as they are special to me. 
The building it's old placed in a save area of Paris – could be 16th quarter– Mija comments to me " at least here they're not CNRS behind the ATM" 


I thought I wouldn't know anyone but he convinces me to go up to the party but the problem is that I cannot lock my door, Mijael kindly finds two massive doors and lean them against the wall to close the entrance of my room, and we go. By then the corridors are pack. 


The last fragment I remember I go pass walking in front of my room, now taken by the school of Architects. The space is change, the entrance is wide open, on the bottom a huge window with high ceiling, the space is likewise a museum projects’ room, tables with towers of books, one on the top of the other. My last thinking is that it would be nice if they can leave in my room, their books when gone. No more than that.

I dream of a park where I'm setting up an art installation in an art show, I'm not sure if the work is mine but I have to make it work. I've a group of black wood planks layers with a design, a laser cut with the shape of the bones of a skull, like a brain. I decide to organize them as a gate, a passage where the visitor can enter inside walk through, a set of 4 or 5 doors put behind the other –one meter distance in between them–. 
I have to do few modifications. The easiest way to start to organize something is to be able to move it. In order to do it so, I have to cut some of the panels in two. I adapt them in the way that they can slide, to left and right, –like closet doors– so then, the visitor can interact with the doors and can walk through them, even on a zigzag path. 


I've a studio beside the park, a workplace in a colonial type house where several artists have their studio, each one in a big room but the house is big enough, in fact I hardly see them.  


A rich collectionneur comes into the park to see the exhibition, he's interested to buy several works. I show him what I have which I believe, is not very much. He is interested in the black gate with the skulls. In the show I have another work, a video installation of Andy Warhol’s recordings. In the dream, I hardly remember how I set it because I feel a strong disconnection with the artwork itself. He asks me the price but I find hard to put a price. We go to my studio to see my paintings but I have only few because I have been working outside. I’ve got the feeling that my studio leaks.
 
This day, in the meanwhile, during the negotiation, his wife wants to visit a shop that is part of the studio complex. She's interested to spend, a little bit of time with a big amount of money, she just buys everything, t-shirts, handbags, etc. I remember a light blue bag she likes and a Donald Duck t-shirt that I encourage her to buy because it looks one of mine, about the rest I’m not really concerned. All that I know, is that she’s probably never going to wear them. 


Time comes and they have to leave. I haven’t decided yet on the price of the installation, the gate with the black doors, anyway he’s decided to buy it and put it in his house. I don't have a clue of how much I should charge. He is also interested in two or three other works, as well as some paintings of Maria Jose Romero, she has a studio next to mine. 
Finally they leave, I stay and try to reconsider what is what I have. I recall to have gone back to my studio to see my paintings." I should have shown to him my serie of paintings Double Vide" it's a shame. 


Finally I remember it's lunch time and Maria Jose, drives me to a place for lunch. There is two restaurant to choose, one next to the other. I like the one that has a menu ready and served, to sit and eat.


The second dream It's a trip on the lands of Chihuahua, the nature is awesome and shows a huge variety of wonderful cactus, over a vast extension with hills. I’ve a major feeling of pleasure and comfort, believe I am with my mother. 


My sensation shifts, when I see the impressive presence of an eagle with a brown rabbit in its claws, I question is if the eagle will eat the rabbit and the eagle answers yes, saying it’s part to its nature. In this boundless landscape I see with excitement a pool, made of concrete but empty of water. Further down, I see the eagle again, this time it's not a rabbit in its claws but the head of a newborn human baby, the body buried into the ground onto the neck, letting just the head out of it. I fear to see what's going to happen next, is her dark scary nature and I rather turn away and look somewhere else. 
Not far from there I see another pool this time we get to the coast and what do I see? I clear light green sea, the most calm water I have ever seen. It looks like air! It's a marvelous thing! We, my mother and I, jump into a tiny boat and takes off the land floating in this water. Is a remarkable feeling of well being.


The third dream and the last. I remember when I was in a lift and get off in a gorgeous garden. With a group of people, we’re comprised in a kind of religious boarding school of some sort, following the direction of the superiors. They brought all of us to the top of a hill covered of wild lawn and magnificent flowers. The sight is wide open to a natural landscape. 
I believe we are divided in categories girls and boys in separate groups. Some boys took the initiative to cut the grass with a machine and the hill rapidly converted in an amazing garden allowing the altitude on the ground of several shrubberies approximately equal with some kind of poppy flowers that I start to pick and make a bouquet. At that moment I experience a great feeling of pleasure, in open natural scene, of what though time to time it can feels like a prison. 


I was feeling a big connection with this wonderful landscape, the boys just cut the lawn and open us a space when the superiors come to tell us to get back inside. It's a shame, why now? I ask her, when we were starting to enjoy our freedom. When I was about to draw on my notebook the flowers I have gather, 
– "What you should draw, she says, is the pistil of a flower”. Why is she telling me what I should draw? I ask. Authority has always been a problem for me. 
Why is that it should be a pistil? a yellow- whitish penis-like geometrical shape made of  little modules stick together in an organic form? I would like to draw a flower yet is not what I should do. It’s a pity, now we all have to leave the garden behind.

At the beginning of last night’ dream I’m part of a work team, perhaps six or eight, among us in this collective project there's Eddie. We’re in a wide room even though it's a fairly known subject, based on the topic of dreams, as none of us can make it work the mood is frantic, the problem stands that we cannot get to sleep. 
I got tired in the effort and decide to take a break and go to a counter where we have the kitchen-stuff to prepare food. I decide to have something healthy, a salad. In order to do so, I take a cucumber and cut it in pieces, but it turns into a nightmare: a mess on the ground. Quickly I bend on my knees and try to clean it but the problem is that once in the floor, it’s not chunks but mashed-cucumber. I feel a huge discomfort, fast I grab from the closet whatever is at hand, the fine white towel –provided by EGI with the equipment– immediately the clothe get saturate of mash-cucumber and the liquid-juice, trespass under the curtain placed behind the kitchen table. Then everyone notice I’m hunker down wiping the floor with effort and little result. 


After, I recall an agitated dream, Nicolas Darrot comes and shows me the design of a truck, Perrine Poirier made but in the dream, I remember Mijael came earlier with a different and better version of Perrine's truck, with electric ramps on the back and both sides of the vehicle. /This one has coarse angles and have to tell him to improve the angles by sanding them and polish the design of the truck. 


We go towards the Atelier in Montreuil. I see the ceiling is now higher and has no windows – reminds me of a hybrid in Lyrica work places– 
Where is the other version of the truck that Mija showed me? Where is Mijael? I decide to call him and ask him to come, but his answer is,
–“Call me after Tuesday" Mijael typically takes life in the most easy convenient way.  
–“What? No, Tuesday no, ahorita" I reply in a slightly authoritarian tone, typically me.
I remember to see then Mija's relatives appear feeling at home, they seat in a sofa in the middle of the studio chatting. I'm persuaded they don't work there, even more when she says her mom is living there as well ! Huna my assistant is here with me, I tell her proudly, I was the first female that lived in the Atelier, while pointing to the top of a scaffold, we use to live there with Mija. Basically because I would like her to get to value of work.

Lorena and a friend of her are on a train, they bought places in a cabin with beds. I have a small suitcase also in the train and go to retrieve my luggage. Lorena has all under control, she has tidy up the cabin and put the jogging suit of her friend over the bed, ready to wear, assuming her friend is going to wear the ensemble during the journey but it’s the only one she has and it’s for a special occasion. She definitely doesn't want to use it to sleep in the train. 
There’s a scene I remember then is the dream, speaking with Lorena while walking across Willard School Sports Fields about a class I have to teach in the school of engineers on Structure and Cement. Honestly, I don't know why they choose me to do this class if I’m busy with my mind already in another work. What I intend to do is to give them a fragment of the "Tao of Cement" let them reflect on that text, is the best I can do. 


The train is ready to leave Lorena has left my suitcase in the corridor in order to have more room for their belongings. My baggage is not even closed when the train starts to move. I have a big coat to squeeze  and pack few others things. It's too late, the train departs and now I can't get off,  I’ll have to wait until the next stop, fortunately is not far in the same town. 
We reach the station is a place familiar to Lorena, perhaps Bristol and she comes down with me. On the rush she kisses me in my mouth in heated passion, I feel true love, our relation hasn't fade out with time. Seated in a café near the railway station, she advises me on the students, saying that if they’re lazy, I can redirect them with Fernan, her ex associate. The train departs and this time Lorena has lost it. She’ll take the next one. 


Last dream I remember I’m in the Andes, in a small Ski Center called Farellones. Roberto is trying to enter to "nata_dreams internet network" but finds difficulties, one of them is Katja constantly distracting him with her chats. 
Guillaume, is in the kitchen of a chalet on his computer and other engineers, cooking. He launches and expressive exclamation when he discovered a message from a Geek Organization that makes him really excited. The engineers look at him surprised willing to know if he won the price. It is not that, but they're going to pay Guillaume fees of the travel, in order for him to go and meet them.

I'm occupied moving 8 pieces of stones blocks, square cut shape, to the studio in the ground floor. Ilan asks me in a skeptical tone what is what I'm doing.

I only recall bits of dreams due to the impact of the noise coming from outside. 


I remember a dream in which Daniel Pons and I are doing a project of a new home. 


Leading the concluding stage to refurbish the house, I have to buy lamps to install from the ground floor, to light the ceiling from the base of a wall.. Although several people is using the house, we still have to fix the electrical installations. In between them there’s a woman not friendly to me but I care less. I'm wearing a glamorous fur coat and yet it seems she's jealous. 


Dani is going in a journey with Javier Muñoz, the carpenter that is also working in the studio, to India. They get along very well. 
Then I vaguely recall a girl... only this and nothing more.


Finally there is a man it could be Jean Fribourg coming back from a trip with his children, not with his wife, they lodge in a work space.

My dream is a party of many people in a dark room. I have a cool flat magnet with the image of Madonna. In the dark, the image has a dramatic theatrical light that allows to see only her contour in the right side of her body, a subtle line from the ear to the arm and leg, remind me of old Flemish paintings. Under the light the same image has a completely different aspect, it's still Madonna but with a sci fi outfit, her head in a square cut shape robot like, in white color. I enjoy to show my magnet to the acquaintances I meet in the party, moving from the dark room to the next room with the big lights on. 


I am excited to move to another party, it's New Year's Eve. I kind of know about a party but I don't know exactly where I only know it "is the place to be" I am willing to know, trying to find out with the other guests of the party, the direction. I am not alone my friend proposes me to go to a cafe but I think if we do that we are to feel easily asleep and to be honest, is not what I would like. 
 
We are now in the parking in the basement when I see Negro "Blacky" Aretxabala, driving a car with Alejandro Boher, sitting beside and Matias León. I believe they know where is the party. I intend to ask him if we can fit in his car, we are two perhaps three. 
Suddenly I awake in the dream and stop myself from expectations, is the most wise thing to do to keep away from deceptions. I gain control over me like never before. 
Negro tells me that Alejo and his girlfriend are going home, Matias and Blacky are going in different directions. I see a split between my friends, this can have a meaningful consequence inside me but as well, I can avoid to have this feeling. Again, the wise thing to do is to flow through the deeds. 


Blacky drive us outside the garage and we get off the car somewhere in the street, it's almost dawn. We bump into two girls that are going to the party, one of them is looking under a big garbage bin placed in the street because she has lost a bag of bananas that she had,
–"My friends are throwing the party and asked me to bring 15 bananas" she says. 
Surprised she cannot find them.

I remember a dream facing a light green and wonderful sea, a beautiful virgin beach of white sand with a lover – is not Arcangel–.


Encouraged to carry out an innovative project and a great business, with the aim to bring people to this place. I exert pressure to make it happen even though he believes, it has been done before. 
For me it is clear that this should not be an issue to not doing it, I don't even believe it is true, yet for him, it's not viable. I suspect the issue is he does not want to bother to make the effort. The situation reaches the point of being suffocating I find no room for me anymore and have to find the way out. Well I believe is just another disappointment, I take it with philosophy and pushes me to look for a way out. With difficulty, we climb a dune of sand crumbling with each step. I manage to advance a tiny bit and a huge effort walking up a pronounced slope. We fall apart, separation imposes itself,  I can overcome the situation with dignity and reach the top. 
Once there I feel free, I see a park and trees across the street, someone comes to me and offer a glass of wine that I accept with great pleasure. Behind, I perceive him following me, it's disturbing and produces my hesitation. 


I suspect this dream does not come from me, it drags an external energy.

Half recall dream of a passage in which we are in skis that allow us to slide in the snow. I'm not alone, we intend to bring an external hard drive at the upper part of a mid-mountain field of a ski station. It's supposed to be the responsibility of a professional skier but he's a difficult man with bad character. We try to bring it ourselves to avoid him. He doesn't want us to bring it nor he brings it.

I dream of Pablo Dominguez deceased and omnipresent, in Mauro and Chelo's workshop. Chelo is going out of the city for few days and I asked to borrow his studio to work with Mauro, like in the old times. 
I come to find the key to an apartment, located on a floor, of an old building in bad condition, in the center of a city.  Chelo is helpful and friendly, makes a tour of his workshop supplies: stained clothing, dirty towels, and sheets to clean brushes, buckets, cans and so on.
My vision of the practice of painting has very much changed since the times we shared studios in Chile, – more than 30 years ago– and honestly I don't think any more of that will serve me . 
By education towards his generous gesture, I hold my tongue and follow him. I admit that I will not use those rags and even more, I don't need his studio. 
While I accompany him to the exit and let him continue talking, deep inside me, an internal philosophical conflict creates as if I did not know what I want. 
What I'm doing there?
We leave the atelier, I go out to say goodbye, we walk in the street at night, through an underground tunnel, which leads us to somewhere like a pedestrian avenue, it's dark and I have the feeling of being near the ocean.  We pass by restaurants and sit in a "Fuente de Soda" where I order a beer and he asks a white-spirit. Promptly Chelo leaves, at once I ask for the account to pay my beer with some coins that he left on the table but it cannot even cover for his mezcal. I put the difference of pocket without a problem.


Suddenly my attention shifts to the concern of a feeling of losing a tooth. Inside my mouth, with my tongue, I can move it and It's just the one that Dr. Blake did. Fuck!
Doctors, is just what I have to avoid in the States and the last thing I wanted, is not having a tooth, do I have to resign myself?
- Now what can I do, how do I remedy it? 
I take it off with my fingers and discover a strange thing, a cell that classifies like a pod with veins. It looks like the underlying wall, inside a fruit. It's horrible! 
I still have the root I'll tell the doctor to make a brand new and shorter one.

I recall last night Erika and I are trying to find the counter of Iberia in an airport somehow familiar to me in the dream. A representative of the airline is concern about the label of my suitcase. I believe I wrote my name and spell it correctly but he, or she, wants to put another one. I have no problem with that I only need a pen to write it again quickly, I am in a rush to get on the plane. 
During the trip, I have a concern, for some reason, I thought we were going to France and I would like to retrieve my credit card. In my mind, I try to fit with difficulty in our schedule, to stop for a minute in the bank.  


Erika and I end-up landing in a Mexican town, which I believe is not our final destination, just a place that has a similar name. First stop is a tiny cute town of European style, but unfortunately, we're just commuting to our final destination a lot less interesting. I'm surprised to see Gabriel Elizondo briefly. I observe something happening to Erika, I'm persuaded Gabriel is trying to help her with business affairs. I cannot relate to what's going on –a familiar syndrome of mine–. It's boring and I don't pay much attention. My focus is on my own concerns, I think about my small suitcase, I carry and the future fact of what to do, four days in a small town that nothing really happens. It's a boring dream. 


Erica's suitcase is big instead I have got a small one, cabin size but filled enough inside for a month of travel. 


The last one I remember is daytime and I'm in a white luminous landscape, a ski station in the afternoon. 
All at once, I see a group of people queuing in a bright pink outfit. Who can miss that? What do I see? At the end of the line is Beatriz Hagel, laggard and clumsy, following the others. I shout her name and she sees me. First thing I evaluate is the color of my light green ski outfit, a color in perfect contrast to theirs. I'm not wearing skis like them instead I slide in my shoes. 
A parallel idea assaults me, a fragment of something else, I have not check my bank account. Out of the blue, I realized that I must have received a transfer from a grant and that I don't have to worry about that.
Who else is there? Mijael, I'm so glad to see him. He's wearing ski boots and my first impression is that they don't match as a pair, typically of Mija is to be slightly outside of the norm. But this is only my feeling cause is the current fashion of ski boots 
They are going towards the ski lift in the field. I would love to go with them but at that point, I lack necessary ski equipment and is already too late to go and rent material. Shame on me, maybe tomorrow.

Al principio del sueño estoy al final de la calle Adams Street, al pie del Bosque en una reunión social informal creo que está Meg Blanchet fumando Cannabis, comemos papas y salsa dip hecha de yogurt. 
Está llegando más gente entre las cuales Dr. Michael Milham y nos invitan a una gran recepción en un restaurante ubicado en una casa ahí mismo. 
El restaurante está lleno. Para comer no sirven deliciosos platillos entre los cuales sólo puedo comer ensalada porque desgraciadamente me llene el estómago de chips. Veo como a los demás le sirven a ensalada con proteínas, aderezo de queso roquefort y salmón, me parece apetecible por su color naranja intenso pero sin embargo no puedo probarla. El ambiente es festivo Michael toma cerveza y se ve alegre. Estoy mal parado se cambió la camiseta con un diseño más juvenil. Michael trabaja en un laboratorio Nueva York ya hace mucho que no lo veía así. Siempre me ha parecido atractivo así que aprovecho para decirle si después quiere ir aún pub a seguir tomando cerveza, pero su voluntad es incierta. Michael tiene una admiradora que lo sigue y creo que no está decidido adonde va a ir. 
Entre las personas que configuran esta reunión, veo que está Catalina Lozano y Katri Walker, parece que no me ha visto y la llamó por su nombre para saludarla mientras estoy haciendo tiempo para ver hacia dónde va Michael. Katri se ve sobrecargada de trabajo, está agotada. Colectivamente hicieron un buen trabajo para recibir a lo grande a tantas personas. Por fin acabaron. Me quedo un rato más allí a fumar marihuana aprovechando el tiempo de emancipación en un ambiente de entretenimiento libre de prejuicios y esperar de ver a Michael. 


Otro sueño transcurre en la casa de mi infancia ubicada en la avenida Las Condes, en Santiago. Tengo unas colchonetas puestas debajo, un aparato de gimnasia, unas barras paralelas instaladas en el jardín. Estoy en mi casa y puedo decidir cómo organizar el espacio decido hacerlo bien y planear un gimnasio mejor. Pasó las colchonetas y los aparatos al patio que está frente a la cocina incluso decido techar con unas lonas que tengo, para hacer un espacio semi cubierto. 
El sueño Me desplaza ahora más arriba en la misma avenida, a un complejo descuidado de condominios dónde se ubican los ex alumnos del colegio Craighouse. Observo los edificios desde afuera sólo recuerdo ver a Jimmy, el cual no veo desde hace tanto tiempo que ni siquiera considero que me conozca. He cambiado mucho desde entonces. En la mano llevo el libro Sueños, Rêves, Dreams que terminé recientemente y me siento orgullosa de mí publicación. Salgo a la avenida para esperar un bus que me lleve a otra parte. Experimento un inadvertido y descarado deseo sexual que estoy dispuesta a satisfacer con quien yo quiera, es sólo sexo y nada más. 
Llegó a una casa donde me encuentro con mi abuela, la cual estoy feliz de ver y como siempre me incita a la libertad. La veo como una amiga y me empodera. 
En la casa hay una piscina y mi ex novio, Chuncho, con el cual perdí mi virginidad, me espera. Pretendo acercarme a él con alevosía porque actualmente vivo en otra relación. En el sueño estoy consciente de que mi libido es un asunto desapasionado, un deseo meramente físico pero que me siento dispuesta a satisfacer a como dé lugar. El sueño se va diluyendo en esa circunstancia después de la piscina Chuncho y yo seguimos a otro lugar. Estoy lustrando mis botas con esmero, les pongo grasa en las juntas de la suela, para que no se dañan con el agua y salir con ellas.

Duermo para soñar que me levanto en este mismo cuarto, frágil y solo con un gran agotamiento. Siento la impotencia de no poder sacarme las gafas para dormir, sólo puedo tocar los objetos ubicados en este lugar. Realmente me encuentro cansada, mis ojos son un mar de lágrimas. Del otro lado del mueble dónde está puesta la cocina, hay una cama dónde aparece Yto. Siento una gran confusión, ¿ cuando llegó aquí? Tengo el sentimiento de que estuvo aquí antes durante las primeras semanas del proyecto pero no sé cuándo se fue. No entiendo, me desorienta no poder ver. No puedo sacarme el antifaz perdí el control y se me caen las lágrimas. Siento una gran impotencia y no sé qué hacer. ¿Tal vez debiera parar este estudio un par de días? Me siento descorazonada y no sé en qué momento me perdí. No puedo parar de llorar perdí la conexión con la salud y lo divino.

Pasó a contar el sueño con Guillaume, es una casa probablemente la mía, conversamos sobre la ropa de color blanco de una cama ubicada frente a nosotros. Hay un duvet, típicamente en el invierno, cuando hace frío, usó otro además de ese. 
Estamos los dos en la cama la relación es fraternal y con mucho humor, me pregunta seriamente si me he Lavado debidamente los pies. Me Toma por sorpresa no sabiendo qué decir, tengo la suficiente flexibilidad física como para olerlos y salir de la duda. No me parece que huelan mal. 
En esa casa veo a mi hermana llega acompañada de otra mujer y diligentemente, aprovecho para pedirle que me devuelva mi juego de llaves. No las necesito pero son las mías y no le queda más que devolverlas. 


Otro sueño estoy en Chile, en la casa de mis primos en Peuco, está mi madre, mi hermana, Jóse y mi primo Huaira. El marido de mi madre se acerca a comentar algo inesperado hay un tipo de camiseta sin mangas que hace buen cuerpo, lo tomo como un llamado de atención para el cuidado de mi aspecto físico. Me traen las camisetas junto a mi vestido negro. Entiendo que el mensaje es que renueve mi armario. Observo porque esa camiseta es tan especial, el rebaje de las mangas es amplio y supongo que esa es la razón pero me queda la incertidumbre. 
Una mujer aparece con una blusa de seda estampada con un motivo de tipo Oriental en un fondo blanco, se acerca a preguntarme qué me parece. Me gusta, se ve con clase. 
Dominique llega con un espíritu renovado, me enseña una blusa de vestir de tela fina y de color gris, con el mismo corte. Es deseable pero me guardo el comentario, pienso que es mejor ser austera. 
Finalmente mi primo Huaira se acerca con comida, es arroz y camarones. Me explica que al arroz jazmín, le va el camarón flaco y largo como el que me trae, mas no el camarón grande. Huaira me sirve mucho arroz y pocos camarones, hago lo posible por servirme más, desmontó unos rollos primavera para alcanzar y sacar los que están al medio.

Recuerdo sólo la imagen de un sueño en el cuarto del taller Lyrica, acostada en mi cama observó un muro, ubicado donde se encuentra la puerta, cubierto de animales de peluche. Arriba, justo bajo el techo un cachorro se lanza sobre de mi cama, aferrando sus diminutas garras a la colcha para no caer al suelo lo que me produce una gran ternura. 


Otro fragmento es el vago recuerdo de Pancho Casas, en una situación de encuentro, un cruce y un límite dentro de una ciudad que estoy dispuesta a defender con sangre.

Un conjunto de extraños conocidos aparece en el sueño. Construí un edificio con muchos espacios, un complejo para los proyectos de varios artistas y lo acabo de terminar. 
Empieza la inauguración y saludo a la gente que va llegando. El lugar es grande y no se alcanza a llenar con excepción de un solo lugar: La cafetería. Allí están casi todos, a la mayoría no los conozco. Antes de llegar a la cafetería, voy de un lado a otro patrullando en el anonimato. No vienen a verme a mí, lo que me parece correcto porque de esa manera soy dueña de mi espacio. Al fondo de la sala hay una mesa en la cual reconozco a Daniel Pons, está con su computador poniendo música frente a otra persona. 
En general el ambiente es social y festivo. Cuando aparece Toño Arango, observo que tiene los labios pintados de rosa, con su piel morena su gusto es francamente patético. 
 
Salgo de la cafetería con un hombre que la memoria del sueño no me permite identificar. La construcción es nueva, al igual que todos descubro de a poco los espacios y mi curiosidad me lleva a otro lugar. Estoy frente a una gran puerta abierta de cristal, noto que el vidrio tiene la marca de un golpe. Adentro parece no haber nadie, al principio pensé que era un comedor y me pregunto porque habrán dejado la puerta abierta. Sospecho que es el lobby de un edificio de departamentos razón por la cual la puerta está abierta. Más allá hay otro, es una sala de conferencias y me encuentro con Lorena Silva, es un agrado verla. Vino a ver la presentación de un atractivo conferencista, pero tampoco logró identificarlo. Los asientos de la sala son reclinables y se transforman en confortables camas. Mientras esta persona hace su presentación, en la oscuridad de la sala se puede ver que no hay demasiada gente lo que añade comodidad y la experiencia se presenta como un placer.

Otro fragmento recuerdo a Cuauhtémoc Medina, hoy es el cumpleaños de su hija Natalia. A su celebración acuden a la reunión los amigos de su padre debe ser una condicionante para ella vivir con él. 
El sueño me desplaza a otra escena, parece evidente que Cristina se va de la relación, se cansó y tranquilamente se retira, sólo eso y nada más. 


Me preguntan qué hago ahí, por curiosidad me quedo a observar cómo se desenvuelve Cuauhtémoc, quiero ver como hace una mente brillante para lidiar con una situación emocional. –" Quiero ver cómo hace con un huevo. ¿Como es eso? " 


Usó en el sueño la metáfora del huevo como un pictograma del flujo entre el dar y recibir, entre los límites que se autoimpone y los límites que vienen del exterior.

El sueño es como retroceder en el tiempo. 
Vivo en París, llevo a Marcela Armas a un espacio blanco y completamente vacío, es el departamento de unos amigos. Es un lugar se encuentra limpio de cosas, el blanco es puro. Entre todos organizamos una velada antes de movernos al departamento de otras personas conocidas, entre las cuales Gilles Fougerat, el ambiente es fraternal. Atravesamos la ciudad al lugar de trabajo de un artista más joven que nosotros, hizo un montaje interactivo con unas pantallas cuadradas que clonan imágenes de Walt Disney para cubrir una inmensa pared. La imagen se reproduce una cierta cantidad de veces para cambiar a otra que reacciona de la misma manera y así hasta cubrir una gran cantidad de metros la totalidad del muro. El autor es joven lo apoyamos con entusiasmo valorando su mérito. 
El joven consiguió las notas que nos han puesto hasta Aquí los maestros a unos meses de terminar el año, en las diferentes asignaturas. Busco con cierta ansiedad mis notas, espero no tener ninguna en rojo, tengo un 4.8 y un 5.0 las dos son azules pero son apenas pasables. No tengo nada de que estar orgullosa pero tampoco es lamentable. 


El último fragmento del sueño sucede en un balneario al borde del mar un área que empieza la gentrificación para pasar de ser un pueblo a un lugar de vacaciones. Un empresario es el dueño de aquel lugar, las casas y cabañas son para sus empleados, así les paga sus vacaciones es un gesto generoso de su parte.

El primer sueño transcurre en la azotea de un edificio.  Compré ese lugar porque planeo construir mi taller, la zona donde se encuentra tiene plusvalía y estoy haciendo mejoras del servicio hidrosanitario. Empiezo por describir la superficie, es de 250 metros.


Jaime Reyes propuso comprar roast-beef para hacer un sándwiches. Encontró uno demasiado rosado, sé dónde venden uno mejor, más cocido, un pedazo de carne en forma de bola. En el camino nos encontramos con David Jolly está sin trabajo y felizmente acepta ayudarme con la construcción del taller. Le describo las características del lugar que compre, la superficie cuenta ahora con 350 metros, es suficientemente grande. Aunque parece abstracto, empecé cambiando el drenaje. Es un privilegio de encontrarme en compañía de Jaime y vamos a otro lado.


Anoche, en mi sueño nos encontramos Arcángel, yo y una mujer, desarrollando un proyecto de exposición supuestamente apoyado por el gobierno. 


Entró a un edificio del servicio público, tipo francés, a una oficina en la cual trabaja una mujer con un aura especial, es dinámica y capaz, su actitud es resuelta. Me orienta hacia otra oficina que ofrece el servicio de trámite que necesito realizar, una coordinación del servicio ubicada en otro piso donde las citas se desarrollan en una sala que consta de sillones y dónde recibo orientación en cuestiones del proyecto. Observó en la actitud de los funcionarios una sana jerarquía a cargo de gente sensata, el ambiente es agradable. La protagonista de esta historia es la mujer que vi en primer lugar, la que me orientó a la segunda oficina y el verdadero peso del personaje, se va midiendo a medida que va transcurriendo el sueño. 


A pesar de que, nuestro proyecto de exposición depende del apoyo y la confirmación de los fondos, uno de nosotros hizo gastos prematuros para adelantar con la producción, no soy yo, ni Arcángel, si no la tercera parte del equipo. 
La escena siguiente sucede en la calle, llevo uno de mis libros de artista constituido en tríptico, solamente la parte superior está terminada, el cuerpo central tiene solo la primera palabra escrita y aun lo estoy encuadernando. Mi hermana quiere ayudarme a pegarle una hoja más pero la capa de cola que aplica, es tan densa que aunque sea transparente va a desbordar y dañar el resto del libro, debe aplicar  una capa más ligera. Decido no arriesgar la integridad del libro. 
En parte ese es el origen del porqué se cancela la exposición. 


Frente a nosotros, un niño de corta edad baja por el exterior de un edificio saltando de un piso en otro por la fachada exterior, apoyándose en los ornamentos arquitectónicos logra bajar los 22 metros de altura hasta llegar abajo y aunque se ve asustado, no le pasa nada. Dentro de todo tiene un equilibrio natural impresionante. Nosotros los que miramos estamos pasmados. 


Veo a mi compañera con los ojos llorosos por la cancelación de la exposición. Paradójicamente, tendrá que devolver el dinero que gastó para la exposición, en un restaurant. El proyecto con Arcángel no se va a llevar a cabo. Me quedo con mi material, lo demás hay que devolverlo. 


Vuelvo al edificio del servicio público, a la oficina principal la cual me dirige a otra más, donde al entrar veo que escriben unas cartas. En ese mismo cuarto, a la distancia la veo a ella, le están probando un gran vestido largo y blanco pero mi atención está en la burocracia. Hay unos boletos de tren, como pases de abordar que tenemos que devolver inmediatamente desprenden el talón con los números. Algunos ni siquiera los use, no me subí al tren. Consideran que no puedo perder el tiempo hay que sumarlos igual a la lista para no tener que devolver tanto dinero y deshacerse del compromiso. En el fondo guardo la terrible esperanza que es sólo un trámite y la exposición se va a producir pero ella me aconseja: no debo permitir que la exposición se lleve a cabo a costa de pagarle los gastos a los otros, y tiene razón. 
Habrá que encontrar un productor que financie pero por ahora no hay candidato que esté dispuesto a pagar los gastos de la exposición. 


A la salida, cruzando el patio del edificio de gobierno la veo a ella en el jardín vestida de blanco porque se va a casar. La mujer es muy popular y todos elogian su vestido. 
En el último fragmento estamos juntas, ella con el equipo y la ropa de ski pero con el cuello descubierto. Le preguntó si no le dará frío y se lo cierra. Cuando me veo, también llevo todo lo necesario a pesar de que hacen años que no esquí pero recuerdo que José Cortés me dijo que el eskiar, asi como andar en la bicicleta, nunca se olvidan.

En el sueño nos preparamos para habitar un departamento apenas terminado. En mi cuarto hice un trabajo previo es un nicho para la toma de agua, que arruinó el acabado en la parte de abajo, la base de un muro. 
Ilan me ayuda a mediar con los contratistas que a su vez juntan a los albañiles para que resanen y pinten, a lo largo de todo un día. 
Los contratistas muy astutos exploran la sonrisa de Ilan y sus dientes, con un sistema permite aislarla del resto del cuerpo, semejante a la sonrisa del gato de Alicia en el País de las Maravillas y que en la oscuridad, aparece por sí sola. Sus dientes revelan que no son los de un niño. 
Eso no tiene nada de extraño. 
Existe un paso entre un edificio y otro, a nivel de la azotea. Un pasillo metálico, un estrecho puente sin barandal por el que tengo que pasar caminando. Ilan pasa primero, este para mí es un gran desafío porque creo que no tengo buen equilibrio guillermo encima unos tequilas. Pensándolo bien no tiene mayor dificultad y debo confiar en mí. 


Otro fragmento de sueño transcurre en un espacio híbrido de gran tamaño, acoge la actividad de un gimnasio pero en vez de que el suelo sea plano hay unas rampas. 
Estoy con otras chicas mirando la rutina de una gran gimnasta en las barras paralelas es la idealización de la maestría. 
Somos un equipo y todos debemos intentar hacer un kippe, una destreza para subir a las barras. Es mi turno pero a pesar de mi voluntad hay algo que me dificulta seguir adelante es una gimnasta acostada en el suelo, justo bajo el desarrollo de la extensión. En vez de darme seguridad exige más control. Me ayudaría más qué acercasen un trampolín. 
 
El sueño me desplaza a otro salgo a caminar por una vecindad y puedo observar casas grandes. Desconozco este sector y pregunto a una de las chicas que viene a mi lado. Justo al momento en que llegamos a la parte alta de la calle, un chico nos indica la dirección hacia "el mercado del sábado" que por casualidad cae justo hoy. 
La glorieta parece ser un límite de la urbanización, del otro lado se puede ver el paisaje montañoso que alberga una zona de volcanes actualmente en actividad. Recién me doy cuenta de dónde estamos metidos a unos cuantos metros, la lava incandescente abrio una grieta susceptible entrar en cualquier momento en una etapa de explosión esto nos alerta y nos alejarnos. 
Seguimos camino hacia el mercado, a unos cuantos metros de ahí. En efecto es un mercado ambulante constituido por stands aún en proceso de montaje, a pesar de ser las 11:00 de la mañana y dónde venderán los productos mas variados. 
Para matar el tiempo erramos de un puesto a otro.

Sueño, un conjunto de personas nos dirigimos más por deber que por placer, en una dirección carente de sentido. La falta de interés general es la particularidad del sueño. Nos desplazamos en una pequeña ciudad entre las colinas y decido desviarme, tomar mi propio camino hacia la cocina de mi abuela donde naturalmente me encuentro a Sully. 
Busco en el mueble, la mermelada de membrillo pero se acabo, mi abuela estuvo últimamente de viaje y desafortunadamente aún no llega - como no encuentro lo que quiero, sigo derecho- 


Más adelante aparece mi hermana entre un grupo de personas mientras camino hablando por teléfono con Javier, en mi sueño es amigo, y con quién estoy planeando una cita. Javier es obsesivo con su trabajo, su atención está puesta en su computador, lo que distrae la conversación y frecuentemente pasa por largos de silencios. 
Mi hermana se para a mi lado los brazos cruzados y me mira con una actitud desagradable, como si se sintiera superior. 
Mi relación con sus ex novios no debiera ser un conflicto, dejo claro que no es su problema, ademas son buenas personas. Lo que pase entre nosotros no debiera importarle. 


En mi sueño mi hermana tiene una condición física sus brazos están pegados al cuerpo, como una muñeca rígida, un juguete color rosa. Es patético no tiene posibilidad de defenderse sin embargo mi hermana siempre encuentra la manera de abusar y ofender. Dominique se construyo un mundo en el cual se siente con derecho a ser superior. 
Pierdo la paciencia, le quitó las galletas de chocolate Oreo a la fuerza, y me voy. 


Dominique perpetua desafiante y provocativa, cansa. Pierdo la calma y un gran enojo se manifiesta dentro de mí. Con fuerza sobrehumana la tomo, la levantó y la lanzo como un tronco, aterriza como plancha. 
Cómo se puede ser indefenso, provocador y ofensivo al mismo tiempo? 
Acaso no se ha dado cuenta que no tengo escrúpulos? 


Al final me despierto en el sueño, tengo a mi hermana encima. Cuando observo un pequeño plato veo una serie de elementos orgánicos entre los cuales un pequeño huevo, saco un nido de paja que tenia guardado, estuve esperando esta ocasión mucho tiempo, sorpresivamente aparece un estornino color café con el pecho dorado y plumas verdes y violetas en las alas. 


Es mi tesoro. Lo resguarde celosamente de las garras de mi hermana que acecha y todo lo destruye. Por fin encontré la aparición del estornino, tiene una carga poderosa propia de una jerarquía mayor.

Sueño una fiesta  de noche, son pasadas las 12 del primer día del año, antes del amanecer. Arcángel propone viajar ahora a Nueva York pero los invitados creen qué es imposible, dicen que sería una locura conducir y de ser así llegaríamos a las 6:00 de la tarde. Arcángel, seguro de lo que quiere insiste y nos vamos. 


En un momento llegamos a Nueva York, Arcángel me sorprende, no sabía que conocíera una ruta tan rápida entre Nueva York y Eugene. Hubiese pensado sino que entre estas dos ciudades hay por lo menos 4 horas de viaje, Arcángel conoce obviamente mejor el camino, planea parar a comprar cervezas a la salida de Eugene, más alla dice, pasando la tienda empieza la ciudad de Nueva York. 


Rápidamente llegamos y estacionamos su auto blanco, un lujoso BMW frente una casa. Se deja translucir la envidia de Erika, al vernos. No me había dado cuenta las horrendas heridas que tengo en las piernas, algunas son nuevas otras me las hice la vez pasada. En particular una, justo en medio de la espinilla derecha, se ve mal y está cubierta de un plasma transparente que parece suero. Lo ideal sería ponerme un parche pero no tengo, en cambio tomo una hoja con mis manuscritos de sueños y la uso para parcharme. 
Pido una segunda opinión. 


Entramos a una casa, pasa una chica enfrente, con los pantalones por debajo de las caderas y la ropa interior a la vista. Sabe que tiene buen cuerpo y su actitud es negligente, nosotros sabemos que es su personalidad. Vuelve a aparecer pero esta vez se acerca al cuarto y sólo viste calzones, para enseñar sus firmes nalgas. 
 
Por último llegamos a la fiesta de un vecino, el ambiente interior consta de molduras y arcos cuidadosamente decorados con pintura y un ornamento casi arabezco. Erika está embelecida por los patrones y espejos, le llama la atención porque es lo que busca, una casa acogedora.

Cuando me despierto Sueño dentro de esta misma habitación, no estoy sola, otros la comparten igual que yo, uno de ellos es Camilo Molfino, hijo del Ing. Marc Moran, quien está en la logia y viene en camino a despertanos. 
 
Salimos al exterior es la ciudad de París, Victoria la mujer de Marc me acompaña y entramos a una brasserie. En la terraza hay un trío de músicos y todas las mesas están ocupadas. Victoria proyecta su ansiedad por el ruido y la cultura se quiere sentar cerca de los músicos pero estos se mueven a la sala contigua. Se ve a Victoria eufórica porque se acaba de mudar a vivir a París, quiere aprovechar cada momento, cada oportunidad que tenga para salir a descubrir la ciudad. Victoria ha sufrido un cambio drástico si proviene de un ambiente de aislamiento y de apego a Marc, ahora va a recobrar su independencia. Victoria vive en un departamento ubicado a sólo unas cuadras de aquí, derecho y a la izquierda, por una calle que se llama Boissonnerie. Noto que Victoria tiene puesta la parka que me regaló Chuncho, un ex novio, y la tomó para llevármela. 


El sueño me desplaza a otra, la ciudad de Santiago, voy caminando de noche bajo la lluvia con una parka sobre la otra. Cuándo a la altura del cruce de la Alameda y la Panamericana me sacude la realidad porque creo que me pase. Estoy mucho más abajo de lo que pensé, camino con prudencia porque son barrios peligrosos, si veo alguien de cerca lo miró con recelo y trato de esquivarlo. Dobló a la derecha hacia la Estación Mapocho por ahí logró subir dónde hay un mercado. Pasó por un complejo industrial transformado, la mayoría de los puestos están cerrados a excepción de uno, el puesto de entretenimiento. 
Veo una pieza roja con forma de dinosaurio, es un juego de bloques de construcción. Se acerca el encargado me pasa otra pieza parecida un poco más adaptada a mí, con mayor volumen y más fuerte. Pruebo suerte jugando a lanzarla contra el muro frente a otro jugador que se encuentra presente. La tiró con gran energía, el bloque rebota y regresa a mí como un boomerang. Sigo jugando y lo hago otra vez, parece que tengo talento para este juego. El encargado se acerca a mí y me cambia el bloque por otro distinto, es un botín de vidrio que giró para ambos lados y mirarlo con curiosidad, entiendo que demanda un nivel más alto un un "cierto status". Vuelvo a lanzarlo. 


Ahora sigo mi camino hacia arriba, acompañada de Enrique Macias está muy sorprendido de ver una casa colonial de dos alturas, bajo los arcos pegaron un afiche espectacular con una de sus obras sin permiso y corre a quitarlo. Hago lo mismo con unos posters callejeros que pegaron enfrente mío, de hecho es una densidad de capas de papel pegadas unas sobre otras, una costra gruesa que desprendo enérgicamente cuando aparecen pacas de ropa. Aparece mercancía de uno de los puestos del mercado, guardada o mejor dicho escondida lo que me agarra por sorpresa.

Recuerdo anoche mi sueño empieza en la casa de Johana, su mamá está arreglando todo para que me mudé a vivir a la casa de la gran amiga de mi infancia, la familia Boher Reifshneider. 
Mi recuerdo empieza entrando en su enorme propiedad, entre unos caballos uno blanco tiene algo extraño en el hombro derecho, un muñón, una protuberancia o una malformación del hueso, quizá sea lo que lo hace tan voluminoso. Al principio sospeho puede ser una enfermedad pero mejor trato de averiguarlo. 


La casa de la familia esta pasando por un movimiento mayor los que la habitaban se mudan. Carol y su marido estan sacando sus cosas aunque parezca paradojico, no tienen claro adonde. Buscaron en San Miguel Chapultepec un lugar para vivir y no encontraron nada que los convenza. El plan de mudarse lo tenian desde hace tiempo, Johanna mama está coordinando junto con su hija Carol, la salida y mi entrada. 


Al principio pensé montar mi taller en la casa sin embargo en el sueño Lyrica es mi taller y no lo cambio por nada. Preguntas se van revelando de a poco. Carol está sacando sus cosas de la casa junto a su marido. Johanna mi amiga sigue allí, hizo su casa donde solía estar la casa de muñecas. Con cierta lucidez focalizo mi atención en la pandereta divisoria entre su casa y mi casa de la infancia. El muro, ahora está cubierto de tejas de madera y cada panel también es diferente, no entre sí pero en la parte superior son semicirculares. Después de tantos años la casa tiene bastantes renovaciones. 


Algo extraño resalta en los dientes del marido de Carol, los tiene chuecos, unos encima de los otros. Carol es una mujer ideal en relación con su pareja, juntos tienen un excelente estatus social, sospecho que viene de esas llamadas "buenas familias". Carol también tiene los dientes extraños, en cada uno de los dientes, tiene una perforación perfectamente circular, un hoyo hecho justo en medio, debajo de la encía. Asi toda la mandíbula superior y sospecho que es igual en toda la boca. Cada diente esta cuidadosamente pintado con un color diferente, unos son verdes otros rosados, en diferentes tonos. Esa diferencia estética parece ser un signo de estatus social, cada diente pintado de un tono diferente es un símbolo de belleza en el sueño, a pesar de lo extraño que esto pueda parecer. -Estan esmaltados como quien se pinta las uñas- fue un proceso que le tomó una semana me cuenta, y los hoyos se los hizo ella misma. 


Mudarme a esa tremenda casa es un gran privilegio y lo tomo suavemente, actuo de manera receptiva, asumo mi nuevo hogar de manera cordial. La mamá de Johanna me muestra como va a reparar el baño -esta justo ubicado donde la abuela tenía su arbol de camelias-. El aspecto rustico se lo da la piedra y tambien porque está abierto a la interperie. Johanna mama va a traer piedras Laja para reparar los muros del baño de la casa donde me voy a mudar.


Mi amiga Johannita va a su casa ubicada a unos metros de allí, decidió por libre albedrio tener un estilo de vida abierto y sencillo, su familia la apoya en eso. Bajo un techo de carpa crecen sus hijos y los cuartos abiertos al interperie, un estilo de vida silvestre. Tiene excelente higiene de vida y se acuestan temprano. Al verla al irse a dormir, observo las camas impecablemente hechas con ese rigor e ingenieria alemana, muy cómodas. Johanna cuida todos los detalles mientras sus hijos duermen ella se encarga. Se levanta para espantar a un mosquito, una imágen mágica. Cuando sale a cazar un mosquito su hermosa cabellera larga, rubia y su camisa de dormir son luz que iluminan el jardin de noche
. 
Al tomar posición de la casa principal, reconozco a Lyrica como mi estudio y la casa de la familia de Johanna aunque es grande, sera para vivir. Asi cuido mi higiene de vida. 


Sigue pendiente averiguar qué tiene el caballo blanco y vuelvo a preguntarlo, me contestan y no es una deformación del cuerpo. La protuberancia ahora es un palo grueso perfectamente cilíndrico, bastante largo que sale del hombro derecho, incrustado dentro del esqueleto del animal. No es una enfermedad, me dicen, sino una "formación". 
 
Veo con un asombro nuevo la casa donde voy a vivir, camino por fuera de la casa hacia abajo de la propiedad, doy la vuelta completa hasta llegar al agua y es el mar. Me explican que seguido hay fuertes marejadas, corrientes marinas durante las tormentas, olas que azotan los vidrios, el agua golpea contra las ventanas. Un pedazo de hielo pegado a la casa despierta mi curiosidad y pregunto el porque? Será que viene del mar? Quedo sin respuesta. 


Maravillada de ver a mi tío Muncho, el vive en la parte de abajo parece increible como una casa grande, une tantas vidas! La mamá de Johanna es de algun modo, suegra de Muncho –debe estar casado con una de las hijas–, eso aumenta mi familiaridad con el como si de extendiera el tiempo. La casa aloja bastantes personas entre otras actividades existe un taller textil artesanal. 


Subo a otra vez a la entrada, en la parte del estacionamiento estoy con Johana y me muestra los perros, hace años que no tienen un doberman. Han pasado muchas decadas desde nuestra infancia, Johanna quiere presentarme a su perro, un pastor alemán hembra y se llama Roberta, tiene 11 años dice en un tono que insinua una antigüedad anormal, una suma rara que expande el tiempo. 




Este sueño empieza con Jonny, como relación actual, salimos de viaje vamos con Kyla y nos estamos quedando en un hotel. Recuerdo entramos en el cuarto a dejar unas cosas y volvemos a salir cuando me acuerdo que olvide algo y vuelvo a entrar al hotel. Un señor tiene un puesto y vende cosas, entre las cuales pan dulce, como sé que le gustan mucho le compró unos a Jonny pero no aguanto la tentacion y el hambre. De camino me lo voy comiendo. Al entrar a la habitación me parece que dejé el dinero encima pero quiero estar segura de guardarlo. Cuando entró en el cuarto una mujer cuida dos niños hermosos, unos 2 años, el pelo claro y rizado. Parece encargarse bien pero quiero estar segura de que guardé mi dinero. Jonny dejó varios billetes de 50 pesos y los guardo. 
 
Vuelvo a salir del hotel el paisaje nos rodea de vegetación boscosa posiblemente un lugar rural. Ibamos a tomar desayuno juntos pero hice trampa me comí el pan y no tengo hambre. 
Quise guardar el dinero en un lugar seguro, dejar claro cual es su dinero y cuánto el mío, asi evitar malos entendidos.

En el sueño de anoche construimos un espacio colectivo, un taller y un proyecto en el que estoy a la cabeza. Esta es mi casa y toca construir la última etapa, muros interiores hechos de material ligero. Un baño tiene una tina, debo decidir si la remplazo por una ducha y ganar espacio o la dejo. Se parece a la tina del baño de la casa en la privada Mascota – en Abraham González– sospecho que puedo estar en una remodelación. Si hago una ducha nueva gano espacio y le da plusvalía al edificio, la otra es la tina y puede agregar un plus en la calidad de vida. Tengo dos posibilidades y debo elegir una. 


Otro fragmento es un sueño en el que estamos de viaje en Madrid, entramos a una tienda de cosas de cocina entre las cuales me llama la atención unas fuentes de acero inoxidable se ven muy elegantes, son alargadas otra redonda y grande como para paella, en México tengo dos ollas de ese tamaño sin embargo mi maleta tiene cupo limitado, otra opcion es pedirle a Arcángel que las lleve en su maleta. 
 
Estan mi madre y mi hermana, a ellas les llama la atención una mezcla de chiles secos rojos y verdes, según mi madre esos son los verdaderos chiles para hacer salsa pico de gallo. En México es común pero para mi madre es algo especial. 
Tambien está mi padre, pero por más que busque su apoyo no hay nada que hacer, siempre ha privilegiado a mi hermano. Todo mi esfuerzo ha sido en vano, esto sigue creando una distancia interior innecesaria. 


En otra parte, despierto en un sueño en el que hoy es domingo, en el departamento de Lorena en Washington. Vine de visita a verla, despierta y se prepara para ir al gimnasio, a clases de kickboxing con Chris. En el sueño a Lorena le funciona pagar un entrenador, así no pierde concentración. Le preguntó si tiene planes, para organizar mi día. Empezaría por un café pienso, cuando por la ventana veo una persona nadando en una piscina lo que me da la idea de bañarme. Le pido un traje de baño prestado, me pasa uno aún mojado y no me dan ganas de usarlo, el otro es azul y sólo me pasa la parte de abajo. Lorena hace que piense mi visita como algo que perdio intensidad pero no digo nada ni sacó nada con forzar las cosas. 
 
Salgo a un jardín, los departamentos ahora son casas y disponen de jardínes delimitados por arbustos. Una vecina aparece persiguiendo a su perro, lo llama pero se escabulle entre los matorrales. Escena siguiente llega una familia con dos hijas, la menor tiene el pelo corto y moreno, habla francés perfectamente aunque no haya nacido en Francia. Un aire conocido en ella hace verme reflejada. Algo me recuerda que es un sueño y sigo concentrada. 
La mayor de las hijas estudia en Madrid desde hacen varios años y también es extranjera. 
Quizás sea la oportunidad que averiguar la razón por la cual naci allí. Pruebo mi suerte al azar y dentro del sueño pregunto para ver si me da una pista acerca del evento. 


–"nací en Generalísimo 69, ahora la Castellana cerca del estadio Bernabéu" 


Esperaba sacar algo pero no dice nada. Estoy hablando con su padre cuando entre los matorrales divisorios del jardín aparecen dos hermosas aves de plumaje color rojo, un especie de gallo y otro cuya poderosa presencia me hace ver todo de manera diferente. Quiero enseñárselo al padre de las hijas. 


Por último recuerdo haber visto un nativo africano, el labio inferior deformado hasta alcanzar una gran protuberancia. Preguntó al padre de las niñas por ser un hombre viajado, conocedor de muchas cosas, me contesta simplemente, son bárbaros. Una respuesta simple, quizás esperaba más de él. –Nada especial por más que preguntó no sacó nada. 


El sueño me desplaza a una mesa, Meg y Timothy junto a unos amigos –quizá el padre de las niñas– consumen cocaina en una pipa, una droga lleva a otra pienso en ese minuto. Me desalienta, no es la manera en que me interesa participar.

Recuerdo una parte del sueño, estoy con José Cortés y es de noche. Es confuso parece una escuela en una reunión de alumnos, Petra Saarinen tiene el pelo largo y se lo tiñó moreno-rojizo, como Carla Taramasco. En una actitud irreverente pido un whisky eso crea un suspenso en el ambiente. Nadie mas lo hace y creo que a José no le gusta que tome alcohol pero decidí que quiero un whisky con Ginger Ale, porque me siento con el derecho de tomarme uno. Sin embargo soy la única que hace eso y me escondo. 
Quiero recuperar mi libertad. Me escapo de José cuando me viene a buscar, tengo sentimientos encontrados. 
Viene a buscarme para llevarme en su auto pero me voy en otra dirección. 


Luego recuerdo a un buen hombre y amigo sincero –podría ser Raymundo el electricista–. Para abrir el compartimento y sacarle el chip a mi teléfono, tomo un clip y con cuidado cambió la tarjeta. El lo hace primero después es mi turno.
 
El hombre se convierte en un niño y me acompaña un equipo de gimnastas, niños de bajos recursos entrenando en el aparato improvisado, con dos pedazos de madera juntos como viga de equilibrio. Para calentar practican salidas desde la viga, destrezas simples como rondats. 
Mi amigo me enseño a cambiar el chip en el teléfono y me acompaño al entrenamiento de gimnasia. Después de la gimnasia voy a comprar un helado como tengo las manos libres, en vez de elegir un helado de paleta, elijo una montaña de merengue con crema y galletas, bañado en salsa de frutas rojas. Voy por la calle comiendo mi helado cuando cae la galleta hacia lo profundo por la escalera. 


Encuentro a Jaime Reyes cuando viene llegando de una de las travesias de la Escuela. Sostenemos una conversación acerca de un pretendiente, me pregunta por Moises Vargas. Sorprendida respondo desganada que lo vi hoy, Jaime inmediatamente se da cuenta que Moisés como persona no tiene mayor valor y al menos de mi parte no queda sentimiento. A Moisés le gusta la discusion y sólo habla de si mismo, en vez de defenderme, mi reaccion natural fue retraerme hacia atrás y hacia adentro. Los demas, los que presencian la escena por primera tal vez pudieran pensar que tiene razon pero convencida que Moisés habla desde la cabeza y no con el corazón, prefiero callar. Jaime lo entiende, la gente que habla sin anteponer su sentimiento, dice, nunca trasciende. 
 
Al final mi memoria me devuelve al primer sueño, una vez más estamos con Huaira en un auto, vamos a la reunión, un retorno al lugar del primer sueño. Abrazados los dos justo cuando aparece mi mamá pero no me importa. Huaira se acuesta en mi falda, cuando descanso encima suyo me dice que tiene hambre. Podria adivinar que le gustaría comer unas enchiladas, o un pollo con mole le digo –Huaira tiene hambre.

Recuerdo mal el sueño, existe una situacion en un relación con la condicion Asperger. 


Más adelante recuerdo el sueño, vivo en comunidad, entre un grupo de personas al borde de un camino, frente a un campo agrícola, una plantación de viñas a las afueras de un pueblo. La comunidad toma forma de un cuerpo de casas situadas al borde de un camino de tierra, un ambiente rural y sospecho que podría ser San Miguel de Allende, solo de nombre. 
 
En este sueño me gobierna un animo rigido e intolerante. Quiero que la palabra de ciertas personas se cumpla con rigor. Me empecino en que cumplan con lo que dijieron. Recuerdo un paso en blanco en mi memoria. Esta presente la intensa voluntad de que la gente haga lo que dice. Es una idea de justicia sin la cual, no puedo estar tranquila, no un sentimiento basado en la empátia con las personas, sino con el hecho de que cumplan con lo prometido. Es un deber hacer lo dicho creo que existe una razon detras.


Al principio me acuerdo de un grupo de gente, seguido me toca ser su líder y tengo la mision de cuidar los espacios. Un hombre, no puedo recordar quién es, es responsable de una imprudencia y me enojo. Una de las vigas que aguanta el peso de un segundo piso es un palo de madera pero me inquieta el hecho de que la viga no esta puesta en el angulo donde descarga la fuerza que sostiene la construcción, no es el punto correcto e incluso puede ser peligroso. Me molesta ver que la viga no hace su trabajo estructural, me enojo, me frustra ver que claramente a los otros o no les importa y no lo ven. 


Mi responsabilidad es la mantención de los talleres y tengo mis razones para creer que está mal. Creo que tengo la razón para creer que esta mal. Me enojo porque creo que no tienen suficiente cuidado y queda claro. 
En el sueño existe una mujer madura y seductora es una bruja en el sentido de sus poderes, vive aqui. A su casa la única que tiene acceso soy yo, es conocida mía. Su espacio es adicional y me permite "llevar las cosas más alla" en acceso diferente al resto de los talleres abierto para mi.  
Entre una casa y otra, la relacion que existe soy yo. La última casa es la de mi madre. 


Vuelvo a soñar una vez mas ese lugar de tipo rural  a las afueras de un pueblo de menor importancia. Ahora mi animo es más amistoso y afable, con más complicidad. 


Persiste la idea del recorrido de casas articuladas al borde del camino, frente a una viña. Es un solo taller lleno de herramientas, un espacio que se dispone como una continuidad. Separar una casa en cuartos y reordenados a lo largo de un camino de cuartos de una casa. 
Existe una relación, con un hombre y es plena, hay atracción libre. Despues de un tiempo fuera vuelvo a aquel lugar, la calle es la misma pero en vez de unos edificios horribles –tipo centro comercial barato, de los años 80– demolieron ese mall para construir unos edificios más bajos más cómodos más grandes y limpios. 
Invitaron a un personaje brillante a la ciudad, no es necesariamente una estrella de rock sino alguien, dedicado a algún tipo de sampleo electrónico. Como grupo de amigos activos, además de tener estos talleres, gozamos de relaciones sociales de calidad en el ámbito. Esta persona había venido hacer esta presentación y tenemos la oportunidad de seguir con el a otras presentaciones. Es una oportunidad para tener una relacion mas cercana y compartir lo que generalmente las personas no pueden entrar de manera abierta. Todo esto no logra distraerme del quehacer o responsabilidad hacia los talleres. 
 
La etapa del sueño en que viene este artista me mantiene ajena. Entiendo que es importante pero me deja sin cuidado desentendida de entusiasmo. Me quedo en los talleres, es mi privilegio. Ahora los edificios nuevos, los talleres aparecen como tienda de herramientas, tan perfectamente ordenadas. Como equipo, me gusta saber el privilegio de estar invitados pero no supera mi interes por quedarme en los talleres. 


Con el pecho descubierto, literalmente me lo cubro apenas con una toalla o algo, en ese sentido mi pecho está libre. 


Aparte de atracción siento mucha libertad dentro del sueño, y también entiendo que existen gente del exterior ellos nos da una posición social. En esto de pasar de un sueño a otro, con este grupo de gente, en la última parte el pasar de un taller a otro se vuelve más lento, pesado y más complicado. Andar con el pecho descubierto es una libertad que me doy, no es de todos. La noción de existen otros “afuera” y que existe un territorio propio, tal vez otra gente le gustaría. 
 
A una mujer en el pueblo, su visión es infantil o tal vez sea una curadora de los 80 retrógrada y fuera del sistema- se le ocurrio invitar al artista, a casa de Pedro Ehrenberg- este evento es un paso más allá en el arte como se entiende tradicionalmente, y Pedro Ehrenberg no está al mismo nivel que este personaje, tal vez Pedro tenga mucho valor nacional pero este artista, es un gran pensador un filósofo un tecnocrata quizás, pero con renombre y fama internacional. 


La constante vigilancia y patrullaje de los espacios de talleres es algo mío, los otros tienen intereses hacia afuera a mí me interesa más ir hacia adentro. Eso es lo que me acuerdo del sueño.

Recuerdo un sueño en una casa de un familiar puede ser la casa de mi abuela y está mi mamá. Me enoja que entro al baño y veo una caca enorme en la taza del baño. Es injusto no solo tengo que limpiar la mía, sino también la de alguien más. 


Salgo del baño me dirijo a alguien, no sé exactamente quién es y le digo qué no es posible además de limpiar mi propia mierda tengo que limpiar la mierda de los otros cuando recuerdo que al lado.... hay un cuarto donde está Larva sentado. 


Lo de limpiar la caca se traduce en esta analogía. 


Alerta! Me siento aterrada, la boca llena con un puñado de alfileres. Estoy tratando de sacarmelos con extremo cuidado, de actuar lo mas suavemente posible, me doblo en dos hacia abajo para dejar caer los alfileres, en su caso porque tengo miedo de tragarme uno y se vaya a ir al corazón, de ser así me voy a morir creo. 
Con mucho cuidado con toda la atención y la urgencia que requiere el momento. Resulta qué fue el janitor "por error", "por accidente" o por torpeza, vuelve a  meterlos otra vez dentro de la boca. El sueño me dezplaza una vez mas a empezar de nuevo apenas terminando de sacarme el primer puñado a volver a hacerlo. Despacio con todo el cuidado de no tragarmelos, es un milagro que no haya sucedido hasta ahora. Imagino como me desentierro los alfileres de la lengua, parecen clavos de tan gruesa la aguja. Estoy indignada porque el janitor en vez de ayudar limpiando, tirandolas agujas lejos, me encuentro con ellas en la boca. Sospecho el janitor los tiró otra vez en la boca!! Con él cuerpo doblado, en esa posición como si estuviera vomitando, si tengo esperanzas de sacarlas, es en esa posición para no correr el riesgo de tragarmelas. 


Me acuerdo antes, en el medio, cuando digo qué además de limpiar mi propia m***** está la m***** de los demás la la otra persona cómo que no quieren que lo diga en voz alta, quizás porque no quieren que larva lo oiga. Pero a mí me da igual esto se tiene que saber, hay que sacarlo no puedo guardarmelo. Estoy indignada está situación es overwelmed. Es una situación que no puedo tolerar en el sentido moral y físico. Más todavía al final cuando sacó los alfileres, pasa un rato mientras me los voy sacando despacio de la boca, observo que no me duele. 
Eso no es normal, (salgo del estado overwelmed de la conciencia para entrar a sospechar, es un sueño. 
No siento dolor ... y me doy cuenta que es un sueño, no siento dolor físico solo un dolor moral. Para entonces es improbable que este muerta y no sienta dolor.

Mi recuerdo de anoche empieza con un sueño en el cual estoy haciendo una pintura, un político en bastidores de tamaño medio, 100 x 80 cm más o menos. Voy a juntar todos los bastidores para hacer un solo paisaje y representa la Cordillera de los Andes. 
Eddie y mi novio me están ayudando a hacer esta Cordillera pero es mi obra, estoy a la cabeza. Pusieron pintura en la base de las telas... un fondo manchado con la figura de un pato! 
Llegó y observó lo mal hecho que dejaron en la pintura, agarró trementina, un paño y limpio la base, el primer plano de la composición la echaron a perder. Bastante molesta, les explico lo que seguramente no saben, la perspectiva atmosférica, en pintura según se van alejando los planos los contrastes se vuelven más sutiles. Mancharon la pintura, es demasiado oscura y rompen con esa ley de la perspectiva. 
Trato de sacar como puedo el color oscuro que pusieron para representar en un primer plano un pato negro, como es la primera capa sobre la tela. En el fondo, básicamente, echaron a perder todo. 
Además de la obra que estamos pintando, tenemos la Cordillera enfrente como modelo. Miren hacia las montañas, les digo, con la luz del sol se ven rosas y según se van alejando apenas se alcanza a ver el contraste de la escena. Del primer, al segundo y al tercer plano, se ve la diferencia de manera flagrante cómo va bajando el contraste. 
A pesar de que saco la pintura negra que sobra, queda manchada la tela y aunque le ponga blanco encima, el negro permea y sube a las capas superiores, el blanco puro es irrecuperable. Parece violento de mi parte quitar todo lo que ellos habían puesto pero es que estamos pintando la Cordillera no un pato gigantesco! Definitivamente me parece grotesco lo que hicieron ni siquiera esta dentro del tema. La composición es una composición de 10 metros de largo para retratar la Cordillera de los Andes todos los cerros y sus los valles estarian puestos ahí. Ahora tengo que recuperar esto. 




Recuerdo otro fragmento del sueño, llegamos a habitar una casa en un pueblo, es una casa antigua tiene por lo menos 100 años. Es una casa vieja, prácticamente en ruinas y llegamos a habitarla para reconstruirla de cierta manera, aunque queremos hacerle un suelo encima. Estoy con alguien un hombre, no recuerdo quién, está empecinado en que a la casa hay que hacerle mejores cimientos, tenemos piedra y la vamos a usar para ello. 
Me siento contenta, totalmente abierta y agradecida con lo que venga, consideró que los cimientos son en realidad refuerzos. Haremos los muros mas gruesos, de piedra, aunque van a reducir del espacio estoy abierta y agradecida de ese lugar donde vamos a vivir.


En principio es una estructuración interior con ciertos refuerzos que la sostienen, y parte del exterior para poder ponerle un piso mas arriba de la casa. Recuerdo que tengo un cuadro que quiero colgar es un cuadro de San Miguel de Allende. Un cuadro chico. 


Luego recuerdo otro sueño en el cual estoy en la calle, un auto frena enfrente mío y me subo el chofer es Isabel, ahora la mujer de Santi. La veo con el pelo de peluquería, parece ser una mujer dinámica, con espíritu marcado, conduciendo su carro. Nos pregunta – "tienen tiempo para ir a comer con los mellizos?". Seguramente tenemos ya un plan pero nos queda tiempo y porque no, tomo la invitacion.  
 
Los mellizos aparecen en el momento del parto, por asombroso que parezca salen por un conducto que da a un río, un riachuelo con suficiente agua para recibir a los bebés. Aparece el hombre primero luego la mujer, están nadando en el río con el barro qué normalmente se levanta en el lecho de un río cuando pisamos. Sorprendida los veo sumergidos en un ambiente silvestre cuando en general los bebés los tienen en espacios asepticos, esto demuestra que los bebés son fuertes. 
Isabel sabe muy bien lo que hace, además de que cuida a los mellizos, generosamente nos invita a comer, debe tener un control activo de su vida. Es interesante ver como madre es capaz de someter sus niños a ambientes... fuera de lo común. 
 
El niño aparece primero, por increible que parezca lo veo hablando con acento español, lo que refleja inmediatamente la historia genética de Santi, en particular de su padre. No sólo habla, es lo que habla y además mide 1.10 o 1.20.  
Aprendío muchas cosas muy rápido! 


Noto con curiosidad de que, a pesar de que habla con acento español, lo que dice es información anormal para haberlas adquirido en tan poco tiempo. Trato de entender de dónde saca esta información y cómo la pudo asimilar. Básicamente tiene el aspecto de alguien de 10 años pero nació hace 3 meses!!! Como puede ser? El sueño tiene dificultades en los tiempos racionales pero intento calcular, 3 meses que llevo aquí más los 2 meses en México, cuando Erika vino de visita y no entiendo. La niña es mas tímida, me causa conflicto pensar en un bebe con roce social pero tiene menos aptitudes sociales. Entre ellos se acoplan bien, juntos son mas fuertes que dos personas, ella to tiene a el y viceversa porque tienen un origen comun. Ella tiene el pelo claro y el se caracteriza por estar vestido de traje por lo menos para ir a la comida. Primero salió el del conducto al agua, luego sale ella, ella tiene el pelo mas corto de los lados –es mi mismo corte pero unos dos o 3 meses más largo–
A él de manera breve, lo veo con ese mismo corte de pelo. Esta realidad es asombrosa! 


Sigo camino, llego a un cuarto con dos camas, en una de ellas esta Rodrigo, a lo mejor viene de la misma comida. Estoy en mi cama y Rodrigo está en otra cama al lado, mientras habla sentado en la cama de manera normal observó con curiosidad que la colcha de la cama se mueve. Sospecho que es una mujer dando sexo oral a Rodrigo, para el puede eso puede ser cosa de cada día. En eso aparece la mujer de debajo de la colcha, la cara cubierta de semen, de manera natural sale de la cama para técnicamente sacarse el semen de la cara. Tira un gel transparente endurecido, como si fuera una máscara de belleza, la barbilla, la boca, la nariz, la cara completa hasta la frente. Queda perfectamente limpia, es lo más profesional que visto.

Después de mucho tiempo vuelvo a un pueblo llamado San Miguel de Allende en México, voy subiendo por una de sus calles empedradas junto a un lugareño. Reconozco una cantina mexicana a la cual solía ir regularmente, quisiera verla por dentro y le pido que me acompañe. 


Otro fragmento ignoro de dónde venimos pero me encuentro con dos personas y los zapatos de una mujer. Hay dos situaciones simultáneas extracto de mi memoria. Estoy dialogando con el hombre cuando aparecen unos zapatos altos negros de mujer, son zapatos elegantes pero lo extraño es que a pesar de ser similares cada pie es un modelo diferente, el par es desigual y así se usan. 


Mi conversación con él va hacia otra cosa cuándo aparecen los zapatos, no pongo mucha atención asumo que son los de su mujer y esa es su libertad. Estoy organizando una salida, quisiera que compartieramos la responsabilidad y quiero dejarlo claro. 


Súbitamente me cae el veinte que estamos en una construcción. Frente a mí veo retroexcavadoras moviendo tierra de manera específica para crear un montículo en medio de una cancha, o sea una explanada bien delimitada. El objetivo de la construcción es poner intencionalmente tierra sobre tierra, al principio me pregunto ¿qué será? pero rápidamente llegó a la conclusión, que es una cama tamaño monumental. Una escultura de cemento con proporciones gigantes, con influencias del Futurismo Italiano y los pliegues de las sábanas a la manera de Umberto Boccioni. 
¡Mira qué novedad! No sabía que fuera un centro de arte, lo bueno es que la cama tiene ruedas, lo que permite meterla y sacarla a voluntad. 


En lo personal creo que es bueno poder vaciar el espacio de vez en cuando. Quizas esa sea una noción de libertad. Mejor aun es cuidar que no se sature. 
Alguien quiere meter un bastidor blanco con un texto, me preocupo que lo pongan aislado de lo otro, a la distancia, para que el espacio se mantenga vacío y disponible.

Sergio el herrero viene a trabajar, lo sueño a el en mi taller fumando marihuana, trabajando relajado, se ve que lo hace con placer, mientras me ocupo en otra cosa. Me despierto y vuelvo a dormir. Vamos a otro taller preparó mis cosas, llevo en mi espalda una mochila cargada de dinero en billetes. Tengo que cuidarme porque llevo el cierre abierto, me dice Arcángel ahora mi ex novio. Gracias a Dios es el bolsillo qué esta vacío pero por las dudas revisamos que el dinero esté dentro. 


Estamos de paso por un gran cine de varias puertas, una de ellas nos lleva los palcos, a lo más arriba. Abajo, frente a la pantalla, está vacío. Vamos acompañados de otra pareja pero mi novio y yo decidimos acercarnos más a la pantalla y bajar. Desconozco qué película venimos a ver. 


Entramos al otro taller, las ventanas son tipo bow-window y con 180 grados de visión, de los tres paneles de cristal y el del medio, el que da a la calle, esta cubierto por una reja. Se ve que quiere protegerse de los ladrones. Deambulamos junto a la otra pareja, sin realmente un objetivo fijo. 
Mi novio Arcángel, y yo, tenemos un espíritu libre, el unico propósito es estar juntos. Encontramos en el segundo piso una mezanine con una cama, mejor dicho una superficie hecha de colchones, el cual caben varias parejas sin revolverlas. Están ellos por un lado y un poco más lejos, nosotros nos vamos a acostar abrazados envueltos en una frazada, la pasión concentrada entre nosotros.

En el sueño estoy en un colegio, por la mañana salgo de curso, otras clases menores son en la tarde. Hay una reunión, una actividad social despues de las clases pero a pesar de que me gustaría quedarme, lo más prudente es que aproveche el tiempo para descansar. Estoy consciente de que el capital de salud es prioritario.

El sueño, es un sueño complejo de contar, es un encuentro entre lo conocido y lo desconocido. 
Es una reunion de amigos pero deriva. Vienen por mi cuando observo una situación que debe acomodarse o dejarse pasar. Mas adelante, se traduce en una oportunidad para un encuentro y realizar algo feliz. 


Mi recuerdo vacila a traves de una extraña condicion, impuesta, a la cual debo reaccionar de la manera más digna posible, afin de provocar una union. 
 
No me salen las palabras. 


Me vienen a buscar, puedo demostrarles que se puede pero hay que prepararse, tengo que ponerme una especie de barniz brillante en el cuerpo, esto para pasar una etapa. 


Es un solo y largo sueño quizás los fragmentos de memoria que se entremezclan.


La siguiente escena es en el campo, mi amiga Johana o una presencia del sueño, de ese tipo y yo, salimos a una pradera de pasto verde, la hierba nos llega hasta la cintura. Un poco mas adelante, recuerdo unas plantas carnosas, peludas, color verde claro, me piden que pose a una foto con la planta, para enviarla a un destino preciso. 
 
Lo que al comienzo, es una historia épica, de cómo avanzar, finalmente se traduce en una cuestión de filosofía, la manera de vivir y de hacer las cosas.


La historia se mezcla con un asunto erótico, alguien tiene que decidirse a soltar. No es una situación de competencia sino soltarse para ir con coraje hacia delante. Para dar el ejemplo, me lanzo primero hacia adelante esperando que reaccione positivamente a consecuencia. 


Otro factor es que tenemos que acotarnos a un margen de tiempo,  ademas las cosas tiene que suceder a un cierto ritmo. Todo esto empieza con la historia de una cama, esa otra persona es un hombre. 


Para concluir tengo adquiridas algunas cosas, otras me gustaría que las adquiera pero eso depende enteramente de él.

La primera parte del sueño esta confusa pero hay un problema. Compré una casa pero no puedo usarla, porque las personas que aun viven alli, no pueden desalojarla, hay un problema aun, en busca de solucion... Me explican amablemente lo que está pasando por qué no se pueden ir, pacientemente los he escuchado hasta ahora, llego el momento o un punto, en que ni siquiera me dicen cuando se van a ir, siempre dejan pendiente esa parte. 


Por otro lado llegó a ver a Diego Latorre, quiero tomar una cita con el abogado la próxima semana para explicarle lo que está pasando y seguramente "hacer algo". Llegué al punto que la tolerancia es demasiada, al borde de la injusticia. 
Compré la casa, la pague y no me puedo echar para atrás, es un negocio que no se puede deshacerse. 


Luego recuerdo voy sola caminando por un pueblo, el sol es como de vacaciones. Me encuentro a Pablo Mackenna en un restaurante o en un salón de fiesta. Mackenna se defiende del amor, observó que Mackenna está enamorado de mí pero no se deja llevar por el sentimiento, no sabe confíar. Llegamos a la parte de arriba de un pueblo, estoy de paso, Mackenna vive allí, es su casa. Mackenna niega el amor porque teme.
De todos, el es el único que vive allí, es su casa conoce bien el pueblo. Entre nosotros dos siempre hubo tracción y este sueño es como un revival. 


Hay una parte poco clara del sueño con Mackenna. No sabría cómo explicarlo, le teme tanto a la situación que vuelve a su estado original rigido y algo conservador pero es tu eleccion, lo aceptó. Yo, voy feliz de la vida, de volver. Veo un puesto dónde venden naranjas y quiero parar a comprar ¡pero valen 281 por 2 naranjas! No tengo dinero para eso. Una o dos naranjas? Las monedas que tengo no me alcanzan, es un caos -pesos Mexicanos en Chile-. En el puesto también venden toronjas, la persona que lo atiende no me hace mucho caso, cuándo me dice el precio le digo gracias que voy a volver. 
Sigo camino a casa de mis padres, estoy en lo que podría ser la carretera de Con-Cón alto, llegó el momento de partir. 
Aqui, el efímero recuerdo de una Webcam. 


Me voy y se supone que Mackenna me va a acompañar al bus. Por una razón u otra Mackenna compra arroz inflado y granos, para él y para mí, realmente es cariñoso. Tengo dos opciones para tomar el bus puede ser en el Estero de La Boca, o voy a Viña del Mar. Mackenna no me quiere acompañar a La Boca, y a Viña del Mar sí, entonces bueno. Voy caminando sin zapatos nos acercamos a Valparaíso cuando siento que el suelo está demasiado sucio. Como que hubo un Tianguis, el suelo quedo asqueroso y yo caminando sin zapatos. 
Después de caminar sobre eso me pongo unos zapatos y lo único que pienso hacer es llegar y limpiarlos. 
En el sueño voy siguiendo a Mackenna lo quiero seducir pero no se deja. En eso, oigo la palabra "no correspondido", -la oigo como despertador- choca, no se integra de manera gentil. Choca. 


Estoy en espera de un premio, mi premio, es un sentimiento en relación al primer sueño de la casa, estas personas, un favor unos hombres que por alguna razón relacionada al efecto cadena, la indisponibilidad de uno genera la del otro pero no es algo que tiene en vista una solución sino que es una situación.

Mi memoria es sinuosa, esta Dian y Les en una casa en la calle Zacatecas, entro y salgo de la casa ocupada en organizar un proyecto con el Dr. Reyes Haro-Valencia. Dejaron una botella de vino y la pruebo. 


Recuerdo luego otro sueño, sentada con Lorena ordenando una maleta, llenándola de libretas y documentos. Mientras hablamos se las voy pasando en la mano una a una, no me consta que sean suyas, Lorena solo es la encargada de guardarlas. De la maleta emerge luz junto con un papel de 13 x 27 cm. dispuesto en vertical, en el centro está mi nombre, parece que me ascendieron y ahora soy directora de un centro multimedia. Lorena guarda sus archivos cuidadosamente en el maletín con toda naturalidad.

Varias personas habitan mi sueño. Sucedió algo exactamente igual que el año pasado, lo mismo, esta Katri Walker y esta delante de un problema. Veo el paisaje cubierto de hielo. Se produce un encuentro y el hielo resulta ser parte del problema. 


Tengo que hacer check-in con varias personas y me estresa. Elabore un plan, como un trick elaborado para poder estar en todas partes de manera simultanea, como una sola cosa. 


Ignoro el origen de la vergüenza. 


Hay cosas incompletas pero quiero asegurarme qué lo voy a hacer bien. Nos dejaron tareas encargadas, tengo asuntos pendientes y debo coordinar los diferentes momentos, así como necesidades de otros mas las mías propias. 
Este es el segundo año que lo hago, esta vez quiero asegurarme que va a salir bien. Debo atender varios problemas de manera simultánea junto con necesidades de varias gentes, el asunto es qué esta vez, quiero garantizar que me puedo hacer cargo de ellos siempre y cuando, pueda salvaguardar lo mio propio. Asegurarme que lo tengo  en vista afin de sentirme cómoda.

Es el cumpleaños de alguien especial, en la celebracion hay una rica comida que solo podemos comer en esta ocasion. Estoy rodeada de gente siempre conservo una dinámica independiente. 


Es pertinente acudir y conversar con gente de importancia. 
 
Una vez mas tengo la oportunidad de comer algo especial y el privilegio me lo creo yo misma. Por ese entusiasmo e independencia que me caracteriza paso de un lugar a otro. Es mi libertad. 
Me encuentro con una mujer. Tengo uno de los orificios de la nariz tapado ademas un orificio es pequeño y el otro más grande completamente tapado. Logró abrirlo y sacarle moco. 


Estoy aprendiendo justamente como dejar algo bien plantado –una planta de hojas delgadas y largas que pinchan– nacen hojas en el medio en el corazón de la planta, del centro, e igualmente brotas hacia los lados, ha de ser algo bastante especial. 


El cumpleaños es de un hombre que quiero mucho, un amigo o un hermano.  
Es una verdadera suerte de poder probar una sopa así una oportunidad que se me da, y la tomo con denotado respeto hacia la tutoría. 
 
Recuerdo una conversacion en esa comida, o a lo mejor inmediatamente después, sobre asperger. Alguien me pregunta qué es Asperger y le digo que es una forma ligera del espectro del autismo, con una alta conectividad neuronal.

Sedimento del sueño del 22 de noviembre. La primera parte del sueño, no hay gravedad y avanzamos a grandes saltos, le di algo en la mano a alguien y era el momento de escapar. Tengo una tendencia esconderme y en ese caso, a escapar por la ventana. No estoy sola estoy motivando a alguien más y salirnos por la ventana, subir al techo y de esa manera huir.
 
Es un asunto con el gobernador de la ciudad, se muda con su mujer. Nosotros nos vamos a mudar y venimos a visitar la casa, planear qué vamos a poner aquí y que vamos a poner allá.
Está mi mamá. Recuerdo que sucedían muchas cosas estamos revisando la casa y los cuartos, entonces el gobernador se tiene que ir moviendo para que nos la cesa. La casa colinda con otra.
 
Varias situaciones simultáneas, esto y lo del centro de esquí con mi madre. Hay dos andariveles, uno de ellos no funciona por eso está el otro. El de la cancha Los Tontos no funciona y nunca ha funcionado. Hicieron una remodelación a la cancha, no entiendo para qué si sigue sin funcionar.
Está también el hecho de que estamos ella y yo, del otro lado y nos tenemos que atrever a dar el paso y hacer cosas nuevas, es abstracto.
 
Está el gobernador es un poco corrupto, está con una mujer quizas no sea la suya.
 
Subitamente recuerdo una rata muerta y otra, esta viva pero no parece rata, no se porque le dicen rata a eso, lo mataron es un pájaro y tiene plumas? O sea que hay "rata encerrada".
 
El gobernador y la mujer tenian la organización de esa casa, el puesto era del gobernador pero nosotros vamos a tomar ese lugar y de manera discreta miramos los cuartos. "Esta es la sala de lectura" yo la veo más como una oficina, una oficina para cada uno. De sala de lectura hay una sala más allá, un espacio abierto hacia otra casa, puede ser tambien que sea parte de la casa de nosotros.
Creo que estoy con una amiga es algo torpe no se si es Erika.
 
Hay una cosa, por un lado esta la tontera y por otro el arrojo.
 
Lo segundo, nosotros vamos a utilizar esa casa el gobernador en cuestión no sé qué onda pero poco a poco tenemos que ir moviendo a los viejos y ponernos nosotros. Hay muchos detalles y la idea general la puedo intuir no a nivel de la imagen sino a nivel de la trama. Es más lo que no recuerdo. 
 
Lo que quería decir es que era una cuestión delicada eso el gobernador y la mujer que creo que era su esposa porque se tenían que ir y nosotros teníamos que tomar ese lugar, pero tenía que ser algo discreto para no violentar. El asunto es que ellos se tienen que ir y nosotros tomar ese lugar. Existen una serie de escondites... a nivel que agarró la billetera y se la doy a ella, para que se vayan.
 
Es momento que se vayan y les estamos "ayudando a salir para meternos nosotros. Cómo hacer para no violentarl? Para no sacarlo de manera violenta. Y que las cosas vayan fluyendo y nos lo dejen.
Lo que se supone era la rata, la primera, la que aparece seca, aplastada y muerta.
La segunda que veo y me digo, órale! si hay ratas aquí puede que hayan mas desde donde vengo! La casa es muy grande, nosotros empezamos desde el otro lugar, al otro lado. La rata negra empieza a tomar un aspecto raro espero que no lo pisen porque tiene plumas.
 
Un animal muy extraño nunca supe cómo se llamaba.
 
En verdad los antiguos no sirven, el gobernador es buena gente pero es un precedente. Los tontos subieron y ahora son solo un precedente. Nosotros, ya no hacemos parte de eso, tenemos una visión. Hay algo que nosotros hacemos mejor que ellos y somos más capaces esta renovación es para algo positivo. Veo el cambio con confianza y respeto pero los espacios aún están ocupados, entonces aparece la famosa sala biblioteca una sala larga, más o menos angosta, muy grande y larga, alguien dice que esta es la sala de lectura pero en lo personal lo veo las cosas con más ansiedad. Es la historia de una pareja y es como para que cada quien tuviera su oficina y su espacio. Y a la vuelta hay un espacio abierto hacia al exterior, tal vez hacia otra casa, cuenta con sillones y todo por si alguien quiere sentarse a leer que bien que lo haya.

En la costa este de Estados Unidos recuerdo el sueño en el que llegó a un Airbnb a la casa de Meg quien me renta una dependencia en una casa grande, y un par de metros más lejos de mi departamento, decidió construir una ampliación. Decidió destruir un muro para construir otro, a todos largo del jardín. Esto repercute en mi trabajo e interfiere con mi espacio vital pero parece no considerarlo, podria tener consecuencias en mi salud como privación de sueño así que me veo en la necesidad de pedirle un reembolso de todo el contrato con Airbnb en relación a su propiedad, un dinero que yo pague por adelantado. 
En total son 5,000 dólares. Meg niega toda responsabilidad además me dice soberbiamente que no me va a devolver nada. Conozco la política de Airbnb y requiere dar aviso de cancelación 24 horas antes, o sea que me puede cobrar un día, pero no más pienso. 
No estoy conforme con el espacio ni con su actitud egoísta para estar en paz bebé haber justicia así que voy a buscar un abogado. Trato de elucidar quién me pueden ayudar, conozco abogados pero necesito uno que pueda ejercer Derecho Anglosajón. Pienso en mi hermano es el único que me podría ayudar, mi condición en esta situación no me favorece para nada y encima de todo es su problema que debo arreglar inmediatamente. 
Al exterior, la ciudad y un balneario, sinergia entre arquitectura del S.XVIII y el S.XIX. Por un lado veo a Meg en un paisaje de grandes avenidas, con edificios institucionales neoclásicos, de cemento con columnas, pórticos y tímpanos del otro, un desconocido un poco más joven alojado en una tienda de campaña dentro del jardín de Meg a unos metros de una playa a la orilla del mar. Es un contraste en el sueño se presenta como algo natural. El hombre está satisfecho en su espacio una sola vez sin embargo, se le mojó la tienda de campaña, fue una ola que alcanzo el lugar donde instaló su carpa y el agua se metió dentro, como es natural mojo las frazadas y su saco de dormir. El hombre esta tranquilo y contento, consideró que tiene más suerte que yo en la vida. 


Otro sueño es un pueblo que bien pudiera ser Zapallar, me encuentro con Pancho Casas junto a su nueva pareja, mi primera impresión es que Pancho después de tanto tiempo decidió asentarse en Zapallar, cosa que no me extraña, por su natural arribismo social pero por las dudas mejor le preguntó. Me dice que vive en un pueblo diminuto cerca de una carretera no lejos de la ciudad de Valdivia ¡Eso no es nada cerca! –Valdivia está lejos, además el clima es lluvioso... "En Eugene actualmente llueve– ellos se ven muy unidos como pareja, me hace sentir nostalgia, me gustaría vivir algún día con Arcángel, en un lugar retirado. 
Pancho y Yura ya no son pareja me pregunto qué será de él cuándo de pronto Pancho me enseña una joya es un reloj muy femenino obviamente labrado y de oro además un anillo de brillantes que me llama la atención porque es justo en ese momento le propusieron casarse. En Valdivia existe la apertura legal de la Libertad de casar parejas homosexuales. De manera bastante rápida pancho y su nueva pareja contrajeron matrimonio esta mañana lo que obviamente nos hace felices. Me pregunto Qué pensará Yura pero en verdad eso ya no importa. 


A mitad vestir y con mallas blancas que accidentalmente se me traslucen, me doy media vuelta y Pancho me pregunta ¿que me pasó? Y ¿porque tengo un parche en el coxis? Tengo un herpes cutáneo pero en realidad es un desastre no cumple ninguna función y, en estos momentos me lo sacó en un solo gesto. Es un caos, en el puño aparecen también mis calzones color café. En ese instante entiendo qué voy mal vestida y vuelvo a la casa, donde está toda mi familia. 


Vamos a celebrar la boda de mi primo. Mi hermana Dominique esta deseosa de llevarse mis altavoces y mi equipo de música, cree que se lo puede llevar porque se lo di a mi querida abuela antes de que muera, pero no es así –si ella no está sigue siendo mío–. 
Ahora tengo 3 pero no se atreve a pedirme ninguno. 


En la casa de mis primos somos varios haciendo cola para ir al baño y muy probablemente prepararnos para la boda. Me indican dónde están los baños pero éstos se encuentran ocupados. Voy con Arcangel vestida de rojo, es la boda de Huaira. 


Le digo a mi madre "No entiendo, no entiendo!!" sufro porque no sé qué pasa y no lo puedo describir porque no lo entiendo.

Recuerdos señal una ciudad y un pueblo en medio de una maniobra con una grúa para mover mi contenedor, suspendido entre los cables. Encontré la manera de estabilizarlo limitar hábilmenteel movimiento oscilatorio, con dos tensores enganchados, a otro. Guillaume y yo empezamos con éxito el proyecto qué tiene por objeto desplazar un contenedor en esta ciudad-pueblo, cuando aparece la policía, se apura directamente sobre mí, me esculca, encuentra marihuana y me convierte en presunta implicada en un delito. Pierre Bellec también está aquí. 


El contenedor quedó completamente abierto, puesto en el techo de los cerrados callejones del pueblo –tipo San Miguel de Allende– la policía llegó a meterse, encontro rastros de marihuana qué dejó Daniela Pérez, me identificaron y eso me transforma en presunta implicada. Mi culpabilidad crea una distancia con Guillaume, la atencion en mi actuar, la necesidad de enjuiciarme, nada que hacer. 
No sólo yo sino también otras personas lo usan para ir a fumar marihuana a escondidas, pero me descubrieron. 
Guillaume entra en una profunda decepción, pero lo hecho, hecho está.

Primero recuerdo un estudio en el cual estamos Mauro y yo, estoy fabricando una pintura pero con otros materiales. Esa parte es confusa. 


Me acuerdo la entrada a la casa del difunto arquitecto Chalo Dominguez, no la vendieron sino que la guardaron. Chalo está viejo pero aun vivo. Está mi mamá, pide que me lijen unos pedazos de madera delgadas las que después seran las partes de una caja para poner mis pinturas, le voy a dar una utilidad. El hecho, es que es un trabajo fino. 


Estoy con Mauro frente a una montaña, creo que es el Mount-Hood, le sacó una foto para hacer un croquis en el muro, con pintura roja. Me imagino una puesta de sol dramática y un paisaje natural de montañas, una de ellas es roja. Le sacó una foto, y lo integró como parte del paisaje pintado. 


Recuerdo el hermano pequeño de Matías Camus, se cree el personaje de Robert Smith, se va alejando. 


Se presenta una confusión pero es mas un malentendido. La Elle es chofer de taxi y quiero que me lleve del museo de la Ciudad de México, a La Dehesa –en Santiago– me puede llevar cerca del mediodía, como a las 12 pero tengo otro plan quede con alguien de hacer otra cosa a esa hora. 
Está mi mamá en esa casa la del Chalo junto a otras personas, a pesar de que es atenta conmigo, me siento en el "grupo aparte" dentro del contexto de la reunión.

I'm with Jim Morrison – I believe at first we're in my studio because I've said I built it. It's nighttime. Jim wants to make love, he seduces me and we are about to get intimate. We're in a bed in a dark room. 


Slowly I reckon the main space of the small chalet my family has in Farellones, in The Andes. The room is slightly different. It's not a fancy place but has enough character for us to hang around. There are his close friends, the rock band and as we move on throughout the chalet they show excitement to be here. Although they still think I built it, is a misunderstanding but I say nothing because I don't think that it matters. As we go around I see the walls vanishing and space opens up. 


Jim and I go around together, his rock band follow us, I see very few acquaintances of mine. 
I introduce him to someone –" he's Jim Morrison" I say ...the real one, still alive in doing that, I realize myself the value of such big poet, rockstar and lover I have by my side. I feel in the dream butterflies in my stomach and a sexual arousal, I get sensitive down there and I have the urge to get close to him again.

Recuerdo el principio de un sueño, es poco pero no menos importante, la fuerte presencia de un perro, es un pastor alemán relativamente joven. Lo importante es que ese perro está ahí para mí, nada más. 
Al principio trato de darle el valor que merece, lo relaciono con mi perro Sambo pero es un error porque Sambo tiene espíritu competitivo. 
Ese perro está ahí para mí, eso es exactamente. 
Empieza el viaje, no recuerdo nuestro origen, sólo el perro, el resto lo olvide como si me lo hubiera sacado encima. 


Llegue a una casa dónde me encuentro acostada en cama con unos lentes para dormir, me saco uno, dos, tres, cuarto, cinco... una serie infinita de lentes! 
Llegó a la casa de mi padre y la casa es diferente, claro. Su casa esta en la penumbra y como si la conociera perfectamente me muevo en forma diligente. Es una situación particular porque está mi abuela y también mi madre. Juntar a mi madre y a mi padre, nunca ha sido algo fácil. 
Entiendo que estoy de visita –una visita mas corta de lo normal– y tengo que aprovechar el tiempo, se supone que debo llevar a mi madre y a mi abuela difunta hace algunos años, al restaurante. No creo que lo haga ahora ni hoy mismo, pero de alguna manera tengo que aprovechar el tiempo. 
Diría que la arquitectura de la casa es un cuarto trás de otro unidos por un pasillo. Primero, voy a buscar a mi padre creo que esta con July –su mujer–, ella insiste en administrarnos el tiempo. Delante de ella, veo un perro de espaldas, parece ser un Mastín negro, corpulento y patas cortas, parece hipopótamo. Me alerta el valor simbólico de ver un perro negro en mi sueño. No muestro mayor emoción, ni expresión alguna y pasó de largo. July quisiera llevarnos de la mano y administrar nuestro tiempo mientras saca su ropa. Para llamar la atención propone llevarnos a todos, a ver a la difunta tante Tati pero no tiene el poder suficiente, sólo tiene ese perro, su nombre es Mr. Kowalsky, y por alguna razón, su teatro se desvanece. 
 
Voy a buscar a mi padre, también difunto, quiero saber cuáles son sus planes. Necesito saber la hora en el reloj pero no me puede responder, mi padre no se comunica con la boca sino de manera telepática, me apuro entonces en ver la hora en mi reloj pero se le acabó la batería, tengo el cable y el cargador con la base pero está todo oscuro. Entonces le preguntó qué día de la semana es pero tampoco me puede contestar. 
Ahora pregunto qué planes tiene, yo sólo cuento con el fin de semana mi visita es mas corta de lo normal, esta vez mi padre habla con la boca para decir "–lo bueno es que no estas casada y tampoco tienes hijos". Siento un velo de confusión que se interpone entre nosotros, el malentendido de que estoy siempre disponible para él. Pienso que es un sedimento de su egoísmo porque la verdad es que no estoy tan disponible como antes. 
Noto en la piel de mi padre una especie de textura regular como la marca que dejan los electrodos en la cara por las mañanas. Con mucho cariño le preguntó qué le pasa, –tienes un virus? No, contesta, ni hace mayor caso, mas tarde confiesa que tuvo un accidente en el baño, el baño es un lugar críptico. Cuando me dice que se cayó al suelo, alarmada me apuro a él para preguntarle –cómo te caíste? –porque no me dijiste? Ahora me siento más disponible y preocupada por él. Mi padre tiene una personalidad estoica, no le da importancia al hecho y no le dice nada a nadie. Lo crítico, no es el golpe, es que estaba haciendo pipí cuando cayó y con humor le digo en francés, "–en gros, tu as pisser sur le toît!" es una imagen abierta a la interpretacion, marco su territorio en la gran cúpula. 
A pesar de haber fallecido, parece natural convivir con él y está en todo.
